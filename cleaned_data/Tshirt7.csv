0,3.0,                       these words too small for a small man and fit my fourteen year old daughter who wears a size    they shrink too much  but  the t shirt quality is excellent and well made  just purchase a size that is at least one size bigger since it shrinks so much      
1,1.0,                       these fit me well  and yet they all have holes  i do not extend them unnecessarily  i remove them by grabbing the bottom  they felt good when they were new  but now they all have holes      
2,3.0,                       these v neck t shirts are very comfortable and i am happy with the fit and feel  the reason for the   star rating is because the shirts have a yellowish tint and i was really hoping they were notably whiter  when wearing a white dress or other shirt  it is easy to see the off white yellowish color of these shirts  unfortunately  using bleach to help with the color was in successful      
3,5.0,                       compr  estas camisetas para regalar a hijos y sobrinos  ellos est n muy agradecidos porque disfrutan de la calidad y comodidad  las obtuve a muy buen precio      
4,5.0,                       in general  i m a picky shopper in terms of quality  but when it comes to undershirts  i only need something of decent quality but at a good price as a point of reference  for my own use  three calvin klein v neck undershirts at costco for        cost more than what i felt was necessary for me  they are definitely of better quality though  so i found these gildans and gave them a try   the fact that they cost less than    per undershirt worried me so i wasn t expecting much  but they are actually better than expected  given the very reasonable price   i laundered them once before wearing one  and my initial impression is that they fit great  i ordered medium size  and i m a size    chest      waist  and are of very acceptable quality considering the price i then compared them to some old costco kirkland v neck t shirts that i ve had for a very long time   these gildans are a lighter thinner cotton  so their durability wash after wash remains to be seen  but i initially have absolutely no complaints for the price the gildan cotton definitely feels rougher than the kirklands  but not enough to prevent me from buying more gildans for the price  the stitching on the gildans is not as smooth or refined as the kirkland s  but again totally acceptable given the price point in the end  as long as you aren t shopping for premium quality  imho i feel this is a very good deal on a set of   acceptable quality undershirts  and i found them even better than expected   if durability holds up after a reasonable amount of washes  i definitely plan to buy these again      
5,5.0,                       perfect fit in chest  waist and length  fabric a tad thin but it is an undershirt  perfect shirt in hot environments      
6,5.0,                       right fit  quality is very good  took forever to ship but i m happy with my purchase     
7,3.0,                       i don t think i m saying anything that hasn t been said in other reviews  the sizing of these shirts is pretty inconsistent  one will fit great  another is super long  another has a huge neck hole  another has short sleeves  etc  they also attract animal hair like i ve never experienced before  i feel like a wookie by mid day  i don t think i ll buy these again      
8,5.0,                       i was in desperate need of some shirts and got these on the fly   i was impressed with the quality   quantity  for the price  the cotton is nice to the touch and breaths well  as with anything cotton i recommend adding some vinegar to you r cold wash the first time to help set the colors  i did not and they faded just a little bit  that is no bad mark on the vendor though  overall very good shirts   top notch      
9,5.0,                       these shirts came in on a timely manner  they fit perfectly as i am pregnant i wanted men s shirts for comfort  i purchased a medium  they wash well and do not lose color      
10,5.0,                       the t shirts are well made  the length is a plus for tall people  so it stays tucked in  i also ordered the multi color package  as yet to arrive      
11,5.0,                       my husband is very picky about his  undershirts   he usually wears  wifebeater  tanks under his dress shirts but could never seem to get them the right length  i first bought a pack of white v neck t shirts to see if he liked them  he did   then i bought a pack of multi colored and it s all he wears now  he even wears them without dress shirts over them  score one for me and for amazon   i ve washed them several times and as long as he lets me separate the white ones from the colors  they all look brand new  i use oxi white with all my white loads and it even gets out whatever he spilled on his shirt  it s rare that he doesn t have a spot of something on his t shirt by the end of the night but these all wash up and look brand new with no fading or shrinking  very happy with this purchase and will definitely reorder when he needs more  thank you      
12,5.0,                       so far i like everything about the product  but do not know yet about durability   this is the first time in my life    years   that i  have ever bought underclothes from any one other that jc penney   the penney s quality hasdipped drastically in the past decade so i made a change   it  looks like so far the quality here is like penney sfrom    years ago      
13,5.0,                       i read a few negative reviews i was skeptical but purchase and am pleased      cotton and good quality  i dont dry my clothes in a dryer so am concerned the neck area may stretch out but have washed    already   times and right now no issues   star in my book happy and pleased i bought   if i feel they to stretched out   hey i may go ahead and put in  a dryer and see whats happens but am pleased i purchased these thankyou     
14,4.0,                       these run fairly big  my husband is a size l and so that s the size i bought for him but they fit him big and long  like if they were size xl  so they definitely run big  m would of been a better option      
15,3.0,                       these are pretty thin shirts and after one wash in cold water and air dry they shrank  i wear a medium and it s width is good but now the length is too small  i ordered a large and after a wash the length is good but the width is huge  i m      and    lb  they might fit you better but not so much me        
16,3.0,                       these tee shirts are a bit bulkynot ideal under a dress shirti bought them to do yardworkand they do the tricki go through so many tee shirtsthat these are the onesthat i don t worry about stretchingor staininga few issues with loose threadsbut would rather have four of thesethan one calvin klein     
17,1.0,                       cheaply made of bottom line cotton material one wear throw away       sorry   never had gildan product so poorly made   explains price break         
18,5.0,                       bought these  because i ve started to become a big fan of gildan s shirts   i really like how they look and feel   these were no exception  although both my wife and i felt like these were not really for men   she ended up using them and i bought another set for her   she really likes them      
19,5.0,                       it s an undershirt  i need them fir work so  the fact that they are loose is just fine  i am a female          s   i bought them because mens undershirts are cheaper than ladies   no complaints      
20,5.0,                       i had read some unfavorable reviews of these t shirts but i still order them and i m very glad i did they are not quite as soft as i d like them but they are very comfortable and have some structure to him if i need more i would definitely buy them thank you     
21,5.0,                       nice quality   fabric weight  i wanted them for sleep shirts   they are perfect great value for the money did not shrink      
22,5.0,                       i am a women      cm and    kg  i bought this to wear at home  as casual   and it fits me great  like a tailormade tshirt or so  i also washe in warm not hot  and the size did not change at all i am also planning to buy some more colors  i can definitely wear under cardigans or as a tshirt under hodies  women  go and buy it        
23,1.0,                       these are the most uncomfortable t shirts that i ve ever bought  first gildan purchase here   they are also a little big in the midsection area  i washed them in hoping they would shrink and feel softer too   they didn t  the material is so uncomfortable on the skin  i tried giving to my teenage son and he didn t want them either  lol  we threw them away  i would suggest not buying  very disappointed with this brand and won t be buying gildan anything ever again      
24,5.0,                                 lb   xl was a little tight around the shoulders  excellent soft shirt  would rebuyi m a big t shirt guy       
25,5.0,                       soft and comfortable  my husband loves them  i bought them here  because the packs at wallyworld come with  grey and  black  and he needed black for under his work shirts      
26,5.0,                       bought these to use as work shirts  i like my clothes a little baggy for comfort and these were perfect  they re soft  breathable  and the v neck wasn t revealing at all so very work appropriate  did a great job as wicking my sweat away too  i ride a bike to from work and my sister said i looked fresh still when i got home from a   hr shift   i m a female if that helps anyone with sizing      
27,1.0,                       the tees were very large and the fabric was very thin  no body to the shirt and felt like i was wearing a tee shirt that was advertised on tv by some young actor  donated the new tees to a homeless shelter      
28,5.0,                       great shirts moderate quality  use them every day and keep a few in my go bags      
29,4.0,                       not the softest shirts in the world  but they re about what i expected for the price  they re not bad overall      
30,5.0,                       i was actually surprised at the quality of these shirts  they are thick and well made  they look really well too  great value      
31,1.0,                       i order a pack of the xl  they are like wearing a  xl in the body and chest  the collar of v neck is made for someone who wears a  xl  i would order a size or two smaller next time  but they do shrink a lot in the wash  the material is like a hanes t shirt      
32,5.0,                       i m not huge  but a pretty big dude  i like to be able to tuck my undershirts in and not have to fight with them all day  and having a gut makes that tough  these are awesome  i went a size too large so i ll drop   down on my next order but i love them anyway  nice and soft  long enough  good price for how many you get      
33,1.0,                       amazon advertise for a tight v neck it is really not  it wide and long down  very dissatisfied i just bought rags  returning it will cost to much money   bought also the white t shirt i should know better not to buy items like online      
34,2.0,                       okay so i got these shirts for my husband but they run a lot bigger i got a size l and for like a  xl texture of the shirts are like and soft but it running big is a huge down side     
35,5.0,                       great quality and fits great  i actually bought these for my husband to wear at work  factory   but they re such good quality i almost don t want him to ruin them at work      
36,5.0,                       very comfortable t shirts  six months ago i bought men s xl and they ve shrunk somewhat since then so they are more form fitting  this time i bought  xl to account for the shrinkage  i would recommend you do the same      
37,5.0,                       my husband has a long torso and this shirt fits him very well  shirts we purchased previously would ride above the belt line  but these shirts sit just below  which is what he prefers  my husband is    tall and has a    waist      
38,5.0,                       i grabbed these before i checked out as my husband wears these types of shirts frequently and his old ones were getting a bit too old  fits well he s        lbs and we got a medium     
39,1.0,                       purchased these fory   yro who wears mens small  they arrived questionably small looking initially and then shrank on top of that  on some of the shirts  the v neck collar seems disproportionately deep to the size of the shirt  these men s small shirts fit my slim   yro son who just started wearing boys size        however  he doesn t like them  this is my least pickiest child who is very open to whatever clothes i buy him  he said the fabric felt irritating on his arm hair  it fit strange on his body  he s average body structure  healthy weight  the sleeves were also very short on him and he couldn t stop trying to pull at them like they must be stuck folded up  they resemble women s cap sleeves  i am real irritated because i needed a bulk of shirts quickly for my   yro who had a growth spurt  bought both variety packs of these shirts and basically have a ton of junk shirts  why is it so hard to get basic shirts      
40,5.0,                       i was looking for new tshirts for my son that didn t cost an arm and a leg  these tshirts fit the bill   gildan is seen as a budget brand but i like the fit and colors and the quality for the price can t be beat  if your looking for designer cotton tshirts that feel like silk then definitely this is not for you  but if you just want a basic tshirt that looks and fits good   at a price point that allows you to pay your mortgage then buy this    highly recommended     
41,1.0,                       only got   shirts nice shirts just missing one  or falsely advertised      
42,1.0,                       just opened the package to try on my shirt  i looked in the mirror and noticed the v portion of my shirt was not centered  i tried on all of my shirts and only one was centered  really wanted these to work but i can t unsee what i now know  hopefully i can get a refund      
43,5.0,                       fit perfectly and didn t shrink in the laundry  for being a    lbs person  i was pleasantly surprised by the fit of these shirts  the length was a bit short when i lifted my arms but the width was perfect and very flattering on myself  these make for great summer work shirts since they help maintain a cool body temperature      
44,1.0,                       this shirt looks weird it s right at the sleeve but wide and too long at chest and waste cheap made better off buying a shirt of better quality     
45,2.0,                       these shirts run wide and short  if you were hoping to get a v neck shirt that would also keep your belly covered  good luck because these wont  maybe if you have no torso      
46,5.0,                       i bought a set of the black and white  i saw a few reviews saying how they did not receive the correct brand  but all of mine are gildan shirts that were brand new from a sealed package  fit and feel great  and a good deal for the price      
47,5.0,                       my husband likes them   they are made in a lighter material   when i wash   dry them the hems roll up   that s my only complaint      
48,3.0,                       i bought these because the photo shows a narrow opening circumference around the neck  i love v necks  but not trying to show off my man cleavage  no one wants to see that   i was disappointed when these arrived and the v sags down to the middle of my chest  beware  the stock photo looks completely different than the product i received if you like a large opening v neck  no problem  average quality  great price if you re looking for a smaller opening v neck  keep looking      
49,4.0,                       i just bought these shirts for work  not the top quality only because the strings are coming out after about wearing each shirt once a week for      hours at work  i would say it lasted for    hours of wear before strings start loosening      
50,5.0,                       i bought these men s shirts because women s usually aren t the greatest fit when ordering online  i wanted soft and a little roomy for work outs and lazy days  love the vneck  makes it not so constricting  love the price for so many      
51,1.0,                       when i opened package it was obvious that these had been returned before  there was cat hair all over the t shirts and they were just shoved in the wrapper not even folded neatly  i will not buy again      
52,5.0,                          per shirt  this is a very good buy  cotton and thick  fits my very nicely  this brand s cost is comparable with fruit of a loom  but much better quality      
53,4.0,                       purposely bought a  xl after seeing all the reviews that it d shrink  out of the package  it felt soft  and thin enough for breathability  i quickly tried it on and naturally it was big since i m actually xl size  luckily since the package had   black shirts  i washed one of it then put in dryer  it did shrink as the others suggested  but luckily  not by much for me  so when i wore it  it did fit a lot better  i m okay with the fit as it borderlines snug to fits as expected  and the length is still slightly below the belt which is my preferred at least although usually i like it a bit longer      
54,5.0,                       these are great shirts and the price was great too  i bought these for my son who is   ft   in tall  these fit perfectly  they look terrific and the colors are good  we have washed them several times and they are holding up nicely  they are holding their shape and the color  the stitching is good and the shirts are sturdy  i would definitely rebuy these and definitely recommend these shirts      
55,5.0,                       husband is a butcher and gets his clothes really nasty all the time  these are great quality for the price so i don t mind them being bloody      
56,5.0,                       i use these as night shirts and they are very comfortable   much nicer material than other brands i have had      
57,5.0,                       i have a hard time finding cheap shirts for women  so that t why i decided to try some men s shirts  these are surprisingly soft  and i think they are cut more like a women s shirt than men s  they re slightly slimmer than the typical men s unisex t shirt  i wear a size    top in women s but usually a men s l is comfortably baggy on me   so the lower section clings a little to my lower abdominal region   my measurements are        bust     underbust     waist       hips   the v neck seems a little deep for a men s shirt  and the sleeves are a little shorter than most men s shirts too  i like them quite a lot  however  next time i order  i will get size xl so i won t have to worry about shrinkage in the laundry      
58,5.0,                       i decided to make my wardrobe as simple as possible with simple shirts   i love these v necks from gildan   i always wash them first and they are pretty soft but that could be the fabric softener i use as well   no more buying expensive t shirts   i wear these all summer and if one gets messed up who cares they cost like    each    and the wife thinks i look good in them  so need i say more        
59,4.0,                       these are great shirts  now i ve purchased these more than once  thing is i don t think i ll buy anymore  these are great but after   to   washes they shrink significantly  super cheap though so worth a buy  i purchased a large  i m         lbs      
60,2.0,                       pros they have held their shape for   wash cycles so far they fit as expected they are long enough to tuck into my pants and not pull out they are thick enough to wear as a stand alone shirt cons the t shirts are not as soft as i would have liked them to be   matter of fact its like wearing sandpaper when compared to the   x ist t shirts i usually wear   if you are used to wearing hanes then you will be okay with these shirts   i like soft t shirts so i wouldn t buy these again unless they were a tri blend or a combed cotton   yes  i m spoiled that way      
61,2.0,                       these shrink badly  but thankfully i bought big enough that for me there fine but i d had bought for the man would of been so bad       
62,4.0,                       i bought both the amazon essentials and the gildan v neck black ts  both are soft and comfortable but which is better  after a wash  both shrinks a little so the feel is good and hugs your body  the black on the amazon essential is a bit darker when place next to each other  the gildan looks a bit faded  not that it is  but next to the amz essential it does look it  the amz essential is thinner and maybe it s that that causes it to feel softer  amz essential is also smoother  feels a little like there s polyester mixed it  gildan is thicker and does feel you get more cotton for the piece  i kept both  since both are worth keeping  price for gildan is better tho      
63,5.0,                       i wanted five shirts to wear during workouts  this delivered five shirts  they did shrink a little after the first wash      
64,4.0,                       it fits perfect and had no problem with it and yes it was comfortable     
65,4.0,                       these were ordered for my son  who is           lbs   for work   they were too big for him   and the v was almost too low to be appropriate for him to wear      
66,4.0,                       i would give a higher rating if the neck on the small was a more reasonable size  it is huge  not at all like the picture      
67,5.0,                       i have always loved gildan since i tried them many years ago  the price was good and the fit was great      
68,4.0,                       i bought these for  weekend  shirts and even though i noticed they were      cotton  i wasn t expecting the length to shrink as much  now they re pretty much square shirts  they ll still work for weekend  at home      
69,5.0,                       i m      and    lbs of standard dad body  the large fit perfect  shirt falls at the openings of my jeans pockets after first wash and the shoulders fit exactly  i like that the neck line is not large like a lot of v neck t shirts  good product  great price     
70,5.0,                       comfy  soft  love them  will update if this changes  with a wash it only shrunk a little  bought a size up and will see if that helps  my husband is happy      
71,1.0,                       after wearing regularly for couple of weeks then fabric got very loose  it looks very loose and did not fit well  i have returned  thank you amazon      
72,5.0,                       awesome tshirts long  i am a woman and  it s hard to find this type  love them fit great      
73,5.0,                       based on previous experience with      cotton t shirts  i purchase one size larger than i wear so when i wash and dry the shirts they shrink to a perfect fit   worked  again so don t hesitate to buy the gildan shirts   the material is soft and mostly wrinkle free   the fit is roomy and comfortable   the seams appear to be well sewn  the v is more of a deep v so if you want shallow v cut on the neck you may not want these   i like them      
74,5.0,                       i ve bought colored t shirts at retail places near where i live   they often don t last too long or the pricing is high   i ve ordered both the long sleeve and short sleeve from gildan and i m a happy customer   their pricing is reasonable and fair and the material cloth is excellent   i will buy from them again and again as long as they continue to perform with price and value      
75,5.0,                       my husband is picky about his t shirts  but he loves these  they fit well and are nice and soft  i have laundered them numerous times and they have not had shrinkage  pilling or misshaped      
76,5.0,                       i like the variety of colors to choose from  these shirts has good quality and fits nicely      
77,3.0,                       you get what you pay for with these shirts  they really aren t too form fitting  as they are just chutes down your torso  which gives my husband the appearance of being slightly chunky  when the reality is not that at all  also the threads in the sleeves start to fall out after a few washings    they will start looking ratty long before they should with that in mind      
78,5.0,                       i m a large  and i order  a on xl on accident     but i m keeping them because there still comfy to wear       
79,5.0,                       i use them as a beater shirt for daily activities  the sizing is good  and material doesn t shrink or stretch much      
80,3.0,                       great fit  however shorts are coming apart from the seams in the underarm areawill not buy again     
81,2.0,                       i like a much subtler v than this and they are a bit stiff and uncomfortable  i ll wash it and update if they are better after a run through the machine on hot      
82,3.0,                       i thought it would be thicker like my other gildan tshirt but i was wrong  it s as thin as hanes or fruit of the loom  i like the softness of     cotton very comfy  it s my house clothes      
83,5.0,                       i often times buy plain men s t shirts just to bang around in in this price was phenomenal they were comfortable they had no tags on them they wash well i will definitely buy these again     
84,5.0,                       i like men s shirts because most women shirts hug my armpits and get sweaty quickly  i have muscular arms and big boobs and these shirts don t cling  but they are just fitted enough to look good even after washing  i washed them on a normal cycle  ignoring the instructions because i m lazy  great deal for the ladies since for    dollars we usually get one flimsy  polyester mix shirt half the quality of this      
85,5.0,                       these are by far the best t shirts i have bought to date  xxl platinum white t s that actually do not shrink after drying them   long enough to stay tucked but not like a tall   too much material to tuck they are very soft and retain the arm and neck shape after wearing them all day buy them you will not regret it      
86,3.0,                       after washing them  they don t hold the same feeling shape as my other v necks  for the price  not terrible  but i won t be purchasing again  i suppose if you decide to go a size up from normal they may fit big on first time wear  but after washing could turn out to be your size  but that seems risky     
87,3.0,                       i just needed t shirts for the gym and these work  they re not high end  but i wasn t looking for high end   they ve made it through at least one wash cycle and are fully useable   so if you re not looking for something special  then these are a good buy      
88,2.0,                       these did not wash well at all  i did not use any bleach and the grey one literally faded out to the point of looking like it was bleached  they aren t that soft even after washing with fabric softener and they come out wrinkled  i won t be buying these again      
89,4.0,                       no real complaints  as these were pretty nice for the most part      
90,5.0,                       seem to be nice shirts  they are very soft out the package and fit as expected  nice colors also  i recommend them  good  lightweight shirt for working out or everyday wear      
91,1.0,                       looks somewhere else they get out of shape fast and have an odd fit  i generally use next level t shirts but thought i would try another brand and it was a big mistake  also they seem to irritate my skin when i wear them  stay away      
92,4.0,                       soft and comfortable  great for the price   wouldn t say it was stylish as my son refuses to wear a v neck  i guess it s not cool enough  but it is cooler than a regular shirt      
93,5.0,                       these shirts are very comfortable and suit my hawaiian life   they were pretty inexpensive as well      
94,4.0,                       these shirts are an incredible bargain for the price of course   the cut and the construction are excellent   the dip of the v neck is exactly as i like   however  after one wash  they are not very soft   maybe that will improve with more washings   another drawback is that the printing in place of a label at the back of the collar shows through a little  i intended to wear them as a regular shirt  not as an undershirt       
95,2.0,                       not like the gildan t shirts i bought a few years ago   these shrank a good bit  though was expecting that    not especially soft   but my primary gripe is that the seams on the inside of the shirt are quite large and stick out a lot  if you think that kind of thing would bother you then this shirt will definitely bother you   at this price level  it s really hit or miss   but i ll look elsewhere next time      
96,1.0,                       these shirts are okay  nothing special  i bought them for work and that s all i use them for  the length is nice and it fits well      
97,4.0,                       i liked everything about these shirts except for the v  it was a little deeper than i originally thought it would have been      
98,5.0,                       i love these t shirts   i wear these instead of the womens  tees because they are more comfortable  they wash and dry well  don t shrink or fade  i highly recommend them      
99,5.0,                       this is the second time i ve ordered these t shirts   they fit well  feel good on me  and  so far have lasted a couple of years  or more  before fraying around the neck   compared with other brands i ve used  these seem to last about twice as long   i would recommend these t shirts to anyone who wants a comfortable  well fitting  and long lasting t shirt      
100,5.0,                       i love these  they re great for wearing around the house  to be honest i bought them to sleep in  i needed v  neck s i don t like anything touching my neck so these were perfect for the job      
101,2.0,                       i bought an s size  it was too big at the begining now after i washed it it shrinked and it fits me better  it s not what i was hoping but you get what you paid right  anyway just an advises don t was it at high temperature      
102,5.0,                       nice price for a set of   different colors  the size is just fitting well and good for indoors or outdoor activities      
103,5.0,                       these are nice t shirts  especially if you don t have an obnoxiously long torso   not sure why it s so hard to find a true medium shirt anymore   i m      and these were the only ones out of three brands i tried that cut off normally and didn t drape over my butt      
104,2.0,                       was very excited taking out of the package and feeling soft t shirts  but  after two washes it s like wearing sandpaper  so for those who are sensitive men  i d advise on buying a more premium product that uses pima cotton      
105,5.0,                       it s hard to find a shirt that fits me right  i ll be switching to these shirts now     
106,3.0,                       love the typical t shirt from guildan they are heavy and comfortable these vnecks    much thinner material and the neck is too deep for me   not supposed to show your belly button    but i opted to keep  cheap enough  just not for intended wear      
107,2.0,                       shirt shrunk drastically after going though the laundry  purchase the next size up      
108,4.0,                       excellent product  good quality  color did not run or ruin other clothes in the wash    i would have given it   stars if only it was a little longer   i am     with long upper body  i ended looking like a belly dancer hurhur   but i think it will fit well for most people        
109,3.0,                       i have these away  they were too big  otherwise they seemed like decent quality t shirts     
110,4.0,                       i love these shirts  they re soft and comfortable  they fit nicely  my only complaint    i ordered these in may and only just got them about a week ago  the order was cancelled for some reason after about   weeks and i reordered and once again the shipping was very very delayed  but  i love them and i m glad they finally made it      
111,5.0,                       good quality  i had some department store shirts that were coming unraveled these seem to be hanging in there  good fit and cotton is not to thick or too thin      
112,5.0,                       you know when you buy a t shirt and you expected to fit right away  these ones do  you just open the bag and just put it own  very comfortable and tag free   plus they are cotton      
113,2.0,                       a good buy in terms of quantity  but cheap and abrasive feeling product  i purchased to wear them as an undershirt for under my dress shirts  serves purpose for that  but likely won t get again  calvin klein or jockey brand are light years ahead of these      
114,5.0,                       very happy with the quality and fit  wanted some cheap white t shirts to cut the sleeves off of for working around the house in florida and these are perfect     
115,5.0,                       i m a woman and i bought these to go to the gym since i like to wear plain clothing and don t really like tight shirts  i ve washed these on several occasions and have given these heavy use  they are still in perfect condition and the price was excellent considering how long they have lasted me  i know these are for men  but the v neck and the colors were exactly what i needed  it looks pretty feminine on me  but i don t really care considering it was just for the gym  i did buy a size small because gildan usually has large sizes  in women clothing i usually wear a large  but i know in men s sizes i am a small  i honestly highly recommend these      
116,3.0,                       a bit disappointing after first wash  shirts shrunk a little after being dried on a low dryer setting  by the second washing the shirts looked quite faded   i wouldn t purchase these again      
117,4.0,                       i like these shirts and i will definitely buy more  but they are a little thin  which could be great for the summer heat  i wouldn t wear them without another shirt on top  because they are a little sheer  they are a stretchy type  so if that s not the texture you re looking for avoid them  i was not expecting it  but it feels very comfy and for that  i would recommend them      
118,5.0,                       bought to wear to sleep  bought large  fits like a dress  but the materials too thick for me  too warm  good if you want that      
119,5.0,                       my main concern was if before wearing this shirt it was going to shrink  but it did not happen  i like the cut and fabric used for it and does not feel hot or uncomfortable when moving  sitting  or picking something up from the floor  as a first wash  its color did not fade out which is a big plus for wearing it a home or around the block      
120,3.0,                       the shirts fit well  but i was very disappointed in the texture being rough on the shirts  i was hoping that after a couple washings that they would soften up  but they have not  i love this brand  but i will not purchase them on amazon anymore      
121,5.0,                       the t shirts fit great and are long enough to stay tucked in   great buy      
122,5.0,                       i ve tried a lot of v necks but this one fits perfect  perfect length  they re comfy as well  doesn t shrink much at all        recommend     
123,2.0,                       i m unsure if these shirts are actually sold produced by gildan  i m     and     lbs  i wear medium tops across the board and i m highly disappointed in this product  the length of the shirt runs halfway down from my waist to my knees  the shirt has too much space as if this size was made for a large xl person  the black is faded and weirdly enough  the rest of the shirts in the pack are all different shades of black  these were supposed to be my work shirts and now i pretty much have to use vneck t shirts as a strict casual indoor shirt  these aren t wearable in a public social setting    very disappointed and won t be buying these on amazon any more      
124,4.0,                       at first  these undershirts did fit a bit too loose  however  after a few washes  they have been  broken in  and fit much better  they are fairly comfortable  and fulfill their purpose of providing an undershirt for button up shirts without showing much and making for a good  professional appearance for work or special events  i d recommend these for those who will have the patience to wash these a few times to get the best fit      
125,5.0,                       my husband loves it     
126,5.0,                       i m a slim    and these in medium size fit me  though they re slightly smaller than my fruit of the looms and hanes medium whites the material also seems a tad thicker than the fruit of the looms and hanes i ve washed these a number of times  detergent  bleach  sometimes fels naptha  and there s no sign of premature wear yet   i ll update the review if they start to have problems before their time  but so far so good      
127,1.0,                       these aren t great  the sleeves constantly fold up  along with bottom of the shirt  the cut of the fabric at the bottom of the shirt is not fitted  and as shown in the images  pops out away from the body  i m a      slim lad  and they make me look like i put on a few pounds around the belly  next level  my old t shirts off amazon are much much better  for only slightly more  i ll be turning these into some oil rags for the cars   they also shrink quite a bit      
128,4.0,                       got these for my boyfriend so he would stop wearing his nicer t shirts when he does car  yard  or handy work  a nice cheap option for when you know you just need a shirt you can get dirty without feeling bad  they were initially a really deep v neck  which he was not a fan of  but after washing them they shrank just enough to lessen the v and now he likes them  fabric does feel a little scratchy  so he says they aren t the comfiest  but not bad enough to mind too much      
129,1.0,                       not sure what the other reviewers are talking about  these shirts when compared to hanes our most comfortable  feels terrible  feels very rough compared to my used hanes dont waste your money  buy the hanes one at sam s club      
130,4.0,                       chemical smell when opened package  but it aired out and went away after wash  so guess it s ok the tshirts are great otherwise  fit is great  thickness is great and v neck is just right   in my experience  gildan is better than hanes or fruit of loom      
131,1.0,                       when arrived  out of package they were perfect  super long for my tall torso  threw them all in the wash to get the chemicals out  they shrank  wont even tuck into may pants now      
132,4.0,                       i like these shirts a lot  they fit as expected and they seem to be of better than average quality  i would buy again if i m ever in need again      
133,5.0,                       i bought these for work because i m tired of how women s shirts fit  the v neck doesnt go too low and the sleeves give me some room  frankly men s clothing is cheaper to buy too  i m      and    lbs and i bought the size small  gave me a bit of breathing room but not so loose that the front gapes when i lean over      
134,2.0,                       the quality of the shirts is crap no amount of money that you can save from this product is worth the product itself is too small the manufacturing qualitie is crap the material is crap nothing about this product is good  nothing can redeem this product including the price point      
135,5.0,                       good deal for the money  run a bit large  but close to standard fit  not as soft as more expensive tee shirts  but when you get a pack of five for       you can t go wrong      
136,4.0,                       this one are as follows size are accurate and really comfortable  the only thing is they fade out after a few washes  but we all know that being that black is a difficult color to keep as new  with this said just follow washing instructions to keep black as new  what i do after washing i dry on cool to maintain the color brightness  finally i recommend the t shirts gildan they do a good job for the price and quality better than other brands that we all know  also they don t shrink that s what i like this brand      
137,5.0,                       this  might be about my  rd batch of the gildan v neck t shirt        these shirts are just as good as hanes or fotl but much better price            shirt after tax and free shipping       wasn t even in a hurry for them but they were in my nearby amazon orange box in   day      i always buy the  xl so when they shrink a little  they fit me perfectly      i wear these shirts  casually  with shorts and flip flops in the heat of las vegas     the girlfriend calls it my uniform         
138,5.0,                       i got these to sleep in  i prefer shorts and a tee shirt to wear for sleeping  i chose men s because i like more loose fitting things and they work      
139,5.0,                       very nice tees  they were bought to wear under other shirts  so my husband would not get so eritatated with polyester work shirt  he likes them enough he s wearing them all the time   will be buying them in different colors    thanks     
140,5.0,                       when you think of gildan  you are getting a well made product  shirts and underwear are great items to wear  comfortable and washes well      
141,3.0,                       love the fabric and softness but after one wash  in cold and dried air fluff  they shrunk to the point where they are a bit tight for me      
142,4.0,                       shirt is a bit thick  and a little tight  but overall good quality and accomplishes what it needs to as an undershirt  amazon has the best price for them that i could find      
143,4.0,                       it s a great shirt for its low price   expect it to shrink a shirt size  the material will be thin but it s well made with no tag      
144,5.0,                       these shirts are now my favorite v neck shirts  they are a nice weight without being too heavy or hot the most important thing about these shirts are the neck holes are proportionate to the rest of the shirt without being stretched and oversized hands down my favorite undershirt  for the quality and price i could not be more pleased      
145,4.0,                       i got these to exercise and so i can be comfertable  the sleeves dont have very good shape or memory so i cut them off  much cooler since i am exercising outside good for the price      
146,5.0,                       great undershirt at a great price  i normally buy the more expensive haines  i decided to give this one a shot  i have to say i actually think i like these better  the quality of the material just seems a bit sturdier  anyway i highly recommend to save a few bucks and buy these over the more expensive haines      
147,1.0,                       in the   pack i received the shirts i received had   different feeling materials and inconsistent sizing   fit to size l as ordered the others were xl or larger not worth the trouble to return at this point they were cheap and you get what you pay for      
148,3.0,                       the price was right but they lack in quality  their soft spun shirts are much better quality  these are a bit wider than i like  easily stretch out looking sloppy   quickly      
149,5.0,                       i first purchased these gildan white      cotton v necks at a brick and mortar    months ago   very pleased with the quality   have held up very well in frequent washings   needed a few spares so ordered these from amazon   they had the same manufacturer s product number as my originals   value for the money is very high   i d get these again since they are a  known  at this point      
150,5.0,                       got this since there s no pack for women  great deal  good quality and durable shirt  doesn t shrink in the dryer and even after multiple washes color still the same  wish there were more assortment colors     
151,5.0,                       husband loved the fit and colors   he was very pleased      
152,3.0,                          ordered   packages and they both came like they were laid on a dirty surface as demonstrated in the photo   the shirts ran a bit large and the neck collars were a bit larger than desired     stars but going with   since the front of the shirt was dirty      
153,2.0,                       let s start with the positive for the price you cannot beat it  but the are far too big for an xl and the white ones are see through  i like to wear v necks at work on casual friday s but these do not make the cut for casual friday s as they are bigger than usual and see through     
154,5.0,                       i like the way they fit  better than i expected  glad i bought   pks  will be set for a while for sure      
155,5.0,                       got them for boyfriend  unfamiliar with brand  lg assorted color   pk for     and the fit was true to the chart  they taper well from the chest down to the waist  and the bottom hem hasn t wrinkled or flipped up  it is a bit of a  deep v   than other undershirts but that s what i was looking for      
156,5.0,                       i bought these for going to the gym and they are serving their purpose well  i usually order medium but i decided to go with small   glad i did  i still have plenty space in the shirt   it doesn t fit tight on my anywhere and is not too short or too long   it rests just above my hips  my only concern  which isn t a huge concern unless you re wearing these out somewhere  is that the black seems to be fading after just a couple washes  aside from that  i d definitely order again      
157,3.0,                       too small and not great quality   now it was only     for   shirts   so not much to complain about      
158,3.0,                       my husband loves undershirts   he wears them all day  and then they become his home t shirts once he s lounging  he has been a long fan of the calvin klein shirts  then moved to polo and was also impressed with lacoste  i liked that this variety pack included grey  black and white v necks  and he immediately was impressed with the quality  i even ordered another set  but i wish that i had waited until after washing them  once they are dried in the dryer  they tend to shrink in the arms in an odd way  whereas most shirts seem to get shorter  these have seams that seem to constrict in the armpits  making the shirts uncomfortable  this is super disappointing  but the issue doesn t seem to happen if you line dry them instead      
159,5.0,                       i ordered a set of these shirts at the beginning of the year and really liked them   so i ordered a few more blacks   i think i will order some white ones when they come back in stock they feel really good  breathable  and i like how long they go   i can wear them under my workout shirts and don t have to worry about showing crack on the squats and when bending over   huge     hahai like the sleeveless as i have had similar shirts with sleeves and they tended to be restrictive when working out i would recommend     
160,5.0,                       gildan is my fave brand t shirt for quality  fit  and comfort  i wore another brand x t shirts for years before trying gildan and while they were comfortable they are not the same quality nor did they retain their shape or last as long as gildan      
161,5.0,                       it s so hard to find      cotton tee shirts   i was really pleased to find a pack of     with only one a blend of     cotton       polyester   they are all soft and comfortable   thank you      
162,4.0,                       not quite true to size  advertised as large  but i find them a little undersized  after initial washing  there was about     shrinkage which is very disappointing      
163,4.0,                       not sure why there are multiple reviews stating the shirt sizes run large   i am in between sizes  m and l  and these review comments on sizing persuaded me to order size m shirts these shirts ended up being true size mediums  and too small even for my skinny       frame   noticed slight color fade after initial rental wash with less than normal amount of detergent so deducting one start from five for this reason   shirt thickness is solid  more than amazon basics black shirts that arrived at the same time   due to the thickness  these shirts are not elastic like amazon basics black v necks ended up giving these   shirts to two friends during weekly basic sessions   fits friends in the      to      height range just right      
164,4.0,                       the other brands tend to be too short   for a taller guy  this one fits well   the shirts needed to be washed when they arrived   maybe  not as soft as would be ideal   but  overall  a very good value     
165,1.0,                       each shirt in the pack fit differently and not well    shirt i can t wear because it fits so poorly  then the underarm seam blew out in this one  live and learn if this covid    has learned us anything  it s that we need to revive manufacturing in america  national security dictates we bring back made in america  from now on i will make a strong effort to only buy made in the u s a  products      
166,5.0,                       i wear this over underwear and suspenders and  it looks great behind a sport coat   dark or light sport coat with jeans or wool slacks   try it and the girls will pay closer attention      
167,3.0,                       i though i was getting a good deal but its turns out the quality is mehhh  literally couple washes and they shrunk  disappointed with the buy     
168,5.0,                       um i m not a guy so i can t really comment on the size i guess   i m       and    lb fyi  needed a black men s t shirt in cosplay and i was afraid of my v necks being too low   and it worked great  i guess i can wear the other   t shirts as gym clothes i wonder why won t girls come to buy these t shirts  they are just sooo much cheaper than the women s ones and come in packs and i don t see a difference in fit  like  it s a t shirt  not a dress shirt  t shirts don t really have a fit        
169,1.0,                       figured for the price id take a chance and if they sucked i could use them as rags  well    they are rags now  these t shirts are horribly fitting  super loose at the bicep and tight everywhere else   and they are not even soft   they have a strange rough feeling to them  one wash a dry on low and they shrunk at least by     i have t shirts that you can wash hot and dry hot and they dont shrink  guess im sticking with next level      
170,1.0,                       they ll become useless after the first wash       
171,5.0,                       i bought my first pack at wal mart  i love these v necks  i m a female      about     and the medium fits great  they hit right at my hip  not too long  i wash a couple times to break them in  they feel nice and crispy just like i like them wal mart is no longer carrying gildan  i think they re using their house brand   george   just like fruit of the loom  hanes  etc    wayyy too long and straight cut  i can stretch out the gildan shirts at the bottom and they stay stretched out at the hip  great for sleeping in and i even wear them to work with a sweater or light jacket over it  if i wear it alone  i iron it   i like the stiff cotton  the crispiness helps when i m melting down from hot flashes  great buy      
172,1.0,                       they do not wash well in cold water they schunkthey also faded the very first tome i washed them   i liked the v neck but sadly they now are washed shabby looking   i did cold water i frye s them omlunon deicate cycle in a brand  new washer and a anti fade laundry detergent   i hope they refund my money     
173,1.0,                       all my shirts are mediums and they fit just fine  these shirts fit as if they were designed for women  it s tight at the armpits and the shirt length barely passes the waistline  it s also a bit itchy and the texture is very coarse due to their cheap choice of cotton  probably the worst shirt i ve ever worn      
174,5.0,                       i am female  i weigh around    lb and am  ft  in and busty  fits great  my hubby also wears these he s  ft   in     lbs  medium build  fits him a great also  soft material  comfortable fit      
175,4.0,                       shirts are as expected   its a good deal  go for it      
176,3.0,                       okay goldman t shirts   quality is fine   short in the arm pit area        cotton so they will shrink and then who knows what they will look like   i wash in  cold and  air dry   they work as an undershirt which is why i got them  they are fine      
177,4.0,                       these things deliver both comfort and correct fit   the rating misses one star because these shirts have too large of a v neck   to get it right  the v neck should have been slightly smaller      
178,5.0,                       this multipack is the dream for tall women pregnant with twins in the third trimester  as i neared then end of my pregnancy  as a tall woman pregnant with giant twins  even the largest of my maternity shirts left me with a sliver of belly hanging out the bottom of my shirt  enter this heaven sent gildan multipack  with only weeks left to go  i just wanted to be comfortable and have the decency to cover the bottom of my burgeoning belly without spending a lot of money  buying this product may have been one of my best life decisions to date      
179,5.0,                       it s okay for pack of shirts for      definitely wearing them to work      
180,5.0,                       let s start with the positive for the price you cannot beat it  but the are far too big for an large  and i usually do wear large  and the white ones are see through  i like to wear v necks at work on casual friday s but these do not make the cut for casual friday s as they are bigger than usual and see through i did one wash of them and run it through high heat and they fit perfectly now     
181,5.0,                       cheap  good fitting v neck shirts  cloth is a little thin and lightweight but at this price is to be expected  definitely worth the price which is surprising since it s a gildan product      
182,5.0,                       bought the v neck to wear with dress shirts and no tie  cotton very soft  has some weight to it that i prefer and we ll made  gildan makes great t shirts  decided to chunk all my old dingy ones and restock with the gildans     
183,5.0,                       nice t shirts  especially for the money   they are not super soft like some brands that charge     shirt but were better than expected   quality is somewhere between those expensive shirts and something that can be found at a big box store   the v neck is wider than most t shirts  but i use these mostly for undershirts  so it doesn t really matter   the also seem to big a touch longer than most t shirts  but i prefer something a little bigger   for    shirt i will probably come back for more      
184,5.0,                       the gildon people did not scrimp on material and the fit after washing and drying was perfect  made of good durable material and dye fast  i bought a medium and the fit was perfect      
185,3.0,                       i got xxl tall size shirts  the fit mor like a regular large size  i washed them once  they wont fit the person i got them for  he has a muscular build but these are too small  i have gotten hanes tshirts in the xxl tal  and they fit much better  hanes is a little thinner than these      
186,4.0,                       good material  but surprisingly  extra wrinkly we ll see if it gets better after a few more wash cycles no tags so real comfortable in that respect      
187,5.0,                       nice v neck shirts i use for work  they are soft and comfortable  i haven t torn one yet  even when wielding  i do think they shrank a little bit in the washer  but its okay  all and all a nice set of shirts      
188,5.0,                       these are some of the best quality t shirts i ve ever bought  like any cotton t shirt they do shrink a little when you wash them  so far the color is good  i bought a few of these at the dollar store  they were off quality  that was why they were a dollar  there s a notable difference      
189,3.0,                       this was a great price as i had a promo code for a discount  they work as great lounge shirts but after one wash  they shrunk up so much      
190,5.0,                       not only are these a bargain  but high quality and well fitting  i would definitely buy again and recommend      
191,5.0,                       i bought these t shirts  and i found they are very comfortable  fit nicely  let s see durability  so far so good     
192,5.0,                       i often wear tee shirts with designs or text that i like for when i am in public   i often wear just plain tee shirts for around the house  during the day or overnight   these fill that need for me  plus they are not just homer simpson white  plus they are not all the same color either   i had already bought a similar in every way gildan   pack before  it was a different color assortment   i jumped on this order too if that tells you anything about customer satisfaction   my design text tee shirts all cost about       ea   these cost just over   ea      
193,5.0,                       i like them  odd i was a white t shirt guy moved to arizona and now i like me black shirts to hide the sweat  these are good  but i wish i had looked at the tall version  its a bit short and wouldnt work for tucking in for me  but i would buy again  fit well at shoulders and underarms  no adjustments needed   problems i usually have with tshits      
194,4.0,                       fits good  but got a size bigger than needed   after first wash  the hem of   shirt came     way out   after a few washes   nd one doing the same   i am ok with this because i only purchased these to sleep in   in case anyone was wanting to know in thickness  they are not thin or too thick  i would say medium thickness      
195,5.0,                       i ordered these gildans and fruit of the loom undershirts   these gildans were thicker and better construction than the fruit of the loom shirts   i am completedly satisfied with them at this point      
196,5.0,                       sturdy  well built shirts that far outlast the uncomfortable and small  knockoffs now made in vietnam for hanes and fotl     
197,3.0,                       i had it in my head that gildan was more of a premium product  maybe  but not this model  these particular t shirts are just average everyday t shirts at best  loose threads and even one major hole after   year      
198,5.0,                       washes well  fit is very good  material is comfortable  i use these as sleep shirts or hang around the house shirts and  in winter  as undershirts under sweatshirts and sweaters      
199,5.0,                       gilden is the best brand for any type of t shirts  they don t stretch nor shrink  it don t matter how much you wash them they will keep      
200,5.0,                       after a loooong delay  knew before buying so no problem with that  i finally got it  fit slightly larger than expected but it might shrink after washing but no big deal either way  i bought   pack so i haven t had to wash any yet  otherwise  feels nice and soft and actually thicker than what i expected  so good for wearing under a dress shirt  which is why i got it  and for just casual wearing around the house      
201,4.0,                       for v neck lovers this is perfect  i was worried after some times in the washer machine would become loosen as i read in the comment section in amazon  but it holds up enough after   times washed i would like it to be thicker because it doesn t seem too resistant to tough uses  so i wouldn t use it for the gym or go out hiking  i only use it at house  office or going to the movie theater      
202,4.0,                       i put one of these shirts on  has soon has they arrived and let s just say with my girl near by you could guess what happened next she said wow  that shirt makes you look really handsome and she never said that to me before   so i definitely plan to buy more      
203,1.0,                       wouldn t buy again shirt is weird made fits funny not soft like info said not a good tshirt     
204,3.0,                       not the best fitment  color is good but that s all that i can compliment on not the best quality   i was better off buying from my local store      
205,3.0,                       these shirts arrived as described and appeared to be just fine when i tossed them in the washer and put them in my    year old son s drawer  he has informed me that he can t wear them because the inside of the bottom of the v has an uncomfortable   pokey  piece of fabric      
206,1.0,                       whoever  is looking to purchase these tee shirts  do yourself a favor  don t  i trying to save you from doing the same  the tees were wrinkled so i decided to wash them prior to wearing them  when i was folding them afterwards i m anal like that  i noticed one tee had a small hole in the front and on another tee the threading on one sleeve was already coming undone remember cheap is cheap and you get what you pay for     
207,5.0,                       excellent fit  high quality at a great price from this seller  prompt deliver to my front door      
208,5.0,                       the art of the undershirt is disappearing  and heat strokes will come for the younger men   the v neck of this shirt ensures it will not be seen while wearing a polo or button down with the top button undone   the cotton will absorb you sweat and as the sweat is evaporated it will help cool you off   v necks were never made to be worn alone  but under a real shirt      
209,1.0,                       the shirts to the extent they did not arrive with threads hanging  did not make it through the first wash without falling apart      
210,5.0,                       if you plan to dry after wash  order a size up  i was expecting that and ordered xxl and they dried to an xl but good shirts for the price and soft  nice colors too     
211,3.0,                       received order  opened pack and dumped all in washer  always wash new clothing   as i was putting in dryer  noticed one of the shirts was missing the left sleeve   nothing has ever happened to me like this before  ever      
212,5.0,                       i tried these once before and i was very happy with the fit and quality for the money i paid for it      
213,5.0,                       the size is just right   the cloth feels very good and smooth  light weight  just what i like      
214,5.0,                       all cotton   fits well   nice to fell new t shirts      
215,3.0,                       the neck line on these t shirts is cut too low   the neck line seems to also lose its shape form more after washing a few times   the shirts are on the baggy side as well  i was hoping they would have shrunk a little  but they didn t   i will still probably wear them as undershirts  because i am cheap and can t return them   but i would opt for a higher quality shirt if i were to be shopping for shirts today      
216,4.0,                       i usually get the next size    xl but went with   xl  fit perfect out of box but shrank on normal dry  will not b using dryer on the rest  material is nice n thick  and might last a few washes  we ll see       
217,5.0,                       could not get my ck shirts so i figured to try these  i must say they are comfortable fit right and hold up in the wash  cheap to       
218,4.0,                       my wife bought these for me and i thought i wasn t going to like them but guess what i love them they feel good especially the v neck s  they are great for the winter also pretty warm  so go out and buy you a pack      
219,5.0,                       i always wash new clothing before i wear it  this shirts are comfortable and soft  didn t lose there color  would recommend them and would buy them again      
220,3.0,                       change the title from   to   pack  it is only       black   grey and   light grey  and i rated low because i only ordered expecting   not    even though others indicated the same i had to learn the hard way  and it is still a good price for   i guess  but change it so it is accurately describing what you are ordering      
221,3.0,                       you get what you pay for   these are ok t shirts  but they won t last long   my dog drools and his spit got on my black t shirt  there was a dried up white line on the front of my t shirt   i though i just wash the t shirt like i do with any other t shirt  after i washed it the white line was still there  my dog s drool took out the dye  not a bid deal  because these t shirt were cheap  but makes you think  does the dye rub off on your skin      
222,5.0,                       love these shirts  they are so soft and comfortable  they do not shrink or wrinkle  i m getting ready to purchase some more     
223,2.0,                       i tend to purchase packs of t shirts from different brands and  i have to say  these have an awkward fit that s just plain uncomfortable  easily my least favorite  taking them all out of my wardrobe  fwiw  i m a reasonably fit guy  not especially muscular  not overweight      
224,5.0,                       my last set of t shirts were from haynes  but the sleeves were too short and they shrunk in the wash  these gildan t shirts are definitely a step up from haynes  the sleeves are a good length and they don t ride up  the t shirts fit well  both before and after washing  overall these had excellent quality and gildan is the brand i ll be buying next time      
225,5.0,                       my sons loves these  perfect fit  and very comfortable  sizing was very accurate  have washed multiple times with no shrinkage or fading of color  cannot beat the quality and value for the price  we will  be ordering more soon      
226,5.0,                       le quedaron bien a mi esposo la talla se ajusto perfecta  la tela no es mala para el precio  no desti e el color al lavar  buena compra   act        do lote que compramos esta vez solo negras son d buena calidad al precio   izquierda nueva  derecha vieja       
227,2.0,                       i ordered these to wear under my dress shirts   i don t like leaving negative comments  but these shirts fit really loose and awkward  maybe because i am not use to v necks  i will probably try another brand in the future  recommend to try a size smaller than you are      
228,5.0,                       these shirts are so soft  we used them as a tie dye project and loved the turnout  they re big on me because it s not my size but were perfect for my husband     
229,5.0,                       after reading a ton of reviews i decided to purchase one size larger than my current size which is large  so i ordered the x large shirts and they came in today  did not fit well very baggie  washed them in hot water and dried them for    min on high heat  they fit perfect now  shirts lost about   inches on the length and about   inches on the chest     
230,5.0,                       money spent well and perfect for layering and as by them selves     
231,5.0,                       i m a  female  nurse and wear these under my scrubs as undershirts  so far they re wearing well after being washed and haven t shrunk  it s a nice alternative to the basic white and sheer undershirt      
232,1.0,                       i bought these to sleep in  and they are rough and itchy  even after multiple washes with fabric softener  they seem to become more rough everytime i wash them  they ll be moved over to the rag pile for cleaning      
233,3.0,                       i bought these shirts because i couldn t understand paying more for a decent v neck shirt  well now that i ve owned these for a little over   months  the stitching is falling apart  the shirts wash and dry terribly  fade and shrink and even with my water softener  and they stretch out after a few hours of wear  i d look elsewhere before pulling the trigger on these  pay a bit more for something that ll last longer  lesson learned     
234,1.0,                       you can also tell they changed it because inside the tagless area  the logo is larger  i did a side by side comparison   must be a new factory  the only reason i always purchased this brand was because i could wear it casually with a small v neck  i used to wear these white v necks with jeans  that was my james dean style  because i personally don t like the feel or look of crew necks  now the really long v looks slobby to wear out  they never should have changed it  be warned  also  it a size larger than expected  the medium is longer  almost a large      
235,5.0,                       purchased for hubby  he likes them because he can wear them out without looking like he just got out of bed      
236,5.0,                       these are light weight for sleeping or lounging around the house   my husband loves them   we recommend      
237,4.0,                       this is a very nice choice of vneck tshirts for the price  i use them to workout and they fit comfortably  these kept the size after washing so no need to buy a size up  i bought size l and i m          lbs      
238,1.0,                       once again  a brand that i trusted has changed its product in a negative way  material does not fit the same  the shirt is significantly shirt than the many that i bought previously  it s probably made differently so that the manufacturing source can profit by a few more cents on each shirt  possibly they are selling a poorer quality product online that is sold in the stores      
239,4.0,                       purchased xlso  the price i paid was great  style  comfort  colors  what is not great about these  they shrink  i m      short all around  these come down to just below my waist after washing  yikes  with that said  buy them for youth or go larger  i should ve ordered larger though they fit before a few washes      
240,5.0,                       i ve been purchasing gildan for very long time now very happy with their products  they offer fair prices for quality garments      
241,4.0,                       i bought these shirts for my own use  and the fit is pretty good for me  the only negative is that about half of them had manufacturing defects  i e   small holes in the fabric that look like a sharp pencil had been poked into each of them in some places  they re fine for wear under a shirt which is why i bought them      
242,3.0,                       do not believe the sizing chart   i have a     chest  so i ordered the xl           expecting that they would be a little on the big side since i was at the bottom of the range   it s like wearing a tent   they are so big that they are useless to me as an undershirt   i need to find a     lb guy to donate them to i thought that the product was pretty good for the price  otherwise  so i ordered another package of large             even these are pretty loose fitting  but they will do      
243,5.0,                       very comfortable    bought a set of   shirts   liked so well  i came back and bought more        
244,5.0,                       bought these for husband cuz he bought those else were he likes the way they wash and last fits good my brother has some all so which he likes them too the price is great for the shirts will buy again if price don t go up     
245,3.0,                       itchy fabric  and not so comfortable  i m hoping as they re watched they get better  the fit is good  the length is perfect      
246,3.0,                       i bought  xl  which normally fits me with most shirts  these shirts were the right size for me    until i washed them   even though i washed them in cold water and used the no heat setting in my dryer  they shrunk quite a bit   now they are too small in the shoulders and the arms  and a bit too short at the waist   i would be willing to buy them again if i could get them two sizes larger  but that option is not available      
247,5.0,                       not a bad product for the money   i should know i have been in wholesale fashion manufacturing for years   my specialty was women s garment dyed cotton product   ok these do have some poly in them   it helps with shrinkage and the weight of the product   the fit is generous the shape well large and comfortable   yet the neck line will hold its shape   would i buy again yes these are for running around  doing yardwork  working out   not stylish just good function   the only problem was the sulfur smell from the piece dyed fabric   its a sign of cheap product  but it came out after the first washing    this is a good go to tee      
248,2.0,                       came with holes in them like in the seems first shirt i put on had a hole in the shoulder update you know i bought them to work in so i still use the ones i got  so the shirt themselves are not bad but the quality control is  i wear the good ones every day but the others came pre unstitched holes  buy at your own risk      
249,2.0,                       i m          lbs  athletic build  med wide shoulders    in waist  facbric was good quality and i was hopeful when i opened the package and held the shirts  i was hoping that the med shirt would fit snugly enough to be worn under a dress shirt  why else would anyone buy a v neck  eww   unfortunately  the shirts were very large around the waist and under the belt line  like   inches too much fabric  meaning it pushed out the dress shirt and was a large bundle of uncomfortable fabric underneath  another case of  made to fit the average   probably works for many  i m not one of those      
250,5.0,                         shirts for    bucks delivered  that s fine by me i wear a large  ordered xl for shrinkage  then they fit perfect these are really decent  colored undershirts for us uniform wearing folk whoturn white t shirts into gross things after one wear      
251,3.0,                       this gets a   star rating because it shrank so much in the wash that it became unwearable  i take a small  and after washing  the small became skin tight  so i got the medium  and the sleeves shrank so much i can t wear them in public  and   personally  i thought i would try something new  but i m just not a v neck type of guy       
252,2.0,                       to be honest  i am very particular on shirts  however  these things fit like a blimp  you either don t dry these and they remain too large  or you dry them to shrink them and they get smaller length wise  but not width wise  for what i paid  they will work out for doing work around the house maybe  maybe an undershirt otherwise its in a donation pile somewhere  but i wouldn t invest in these shirts again  sometimes it pays to invest more in something you can try on first      
253,1.0,                       if you re the kind of guy that goes in public wearing a fake gold chain around your neck and fake rolex on your left wrist the v neck t shirt is perfect for you  if you re the kind of guy who fondles his fake gold chain with his left hand whilst caressing his fake rolex with his right hand the v neck t shirt was made specifically for you  if you re not this kind of guy you should steer clear of the v neck t shirt as to not be confused for the kind of guy who wears v neck t shirts      
254,5.0,                       i recently lost a lot of weight and decided to freshen up my undershirt drawer  i know i went down a size in regular shirts but didnt realize i went down two in how i like my undershirts to fit  these are great for the price and couldnt complain  will be reordering in a smaller size      
255,1.0,                       after the first wash shirts shrink fit really awkward tight in the chest very loose at the bottom best way to describe it it fits like a sunday dress looks but as a shirt     
256,2.0,                       i wear v neck t shirts under my dress shirts every day   i was very happy with the kirland v necks t shirts  but they stopped making them   i saw the price on these and decided to give them a try   when i put the first one on right out of the package  i was pleasantly surprised   they fit about as expected  maybe a slightly big in the chest and shoulders  but that s ok   i would prefer that over being too tight   after week    i was happy with my purchase   however  one wash cycle  on cold  and then straight to hanger to dry  no dryer   they completely lost their shape   i did not notice them shrinking at all  but they did not hold their shape at all   on the second wash  i decided to try them in the dryer on a low setting  which made no difference the bottom line is that in this case  you do get what you pay for   a poor quality t shirt that just doesn t hold up   i won t be buying these again      
257,5.0,                       many brands of white t shirts are disappointing  but these are good quality and look and feel great      
258,3.0,                       they are great color  quantity and size wise  however the v necks aren t all the same shape distance  some come down way too far      
259,5.0,                       these are great shirts especially for the price  i m      and    lbs  so the fit at the waist is baggy  but i expected this  the length an shoulder width is perfect      
260,5.0,                       i bought the gildan men s assorted v neck t shirts multipack in  xl for ease of wearing because of an upcoming major shoulder surgery   i normally wear an xl in t shirt sizes   this was a good choice with the v neck and extra sizing which allowed me to wear change with little difficulty following surgery   the shirt material is what i would call a comfortable medium weight and has held up well from  multiple washings with slight shrinkage over   months time   all in all a great buy and a great product that got me through my immediate needs   i would highly recommend this product for anyone contemplating shoulder surgery and to buy one size larger than their normal size   otherwise  pick your normal size edit update   did a hot wash   dry on the  xl to see if could get to shrink closer to an xl   they did shrink some   more vertical than around  if that makes sense   they are still a little large for me   will be good for knocking around outside in warmer weather      
261,2.0,                       top t shirt has square spot   i will try to wash it  if it does not come out i will request a refund      
262,1.0,                       they say you get what you pay for  well it certainly holds true here  i got these on special for    and thought it was a good deal  got them yesterday and washed them  i think my   year old can wear them now  they shrunk to nothing on low heat  the worst part is how wrinkled they were  i mean i d need to iron them just to wear them  nah sir  back and the box and going back to amazon      
263,3.0,                       these t shirts were not made with precision     within the same package that is supposed to be the same size  some of the t shirts are smaller than others   the fabric is not consistent and it is not super soft  but  ok    for the price these are ok  but the inconsistency in size means i only wear   of the   shirts     not sure what is up with the manufacturing and fabric sourcing     hmmm         
264,5.0,                       shirt felt perfect i would recommend going a size down though i bought it in a  xl the first time and it was a little too big   but i can tell the actual quality of the shirt is great      
265,5.0,                       these shirts are great  they are an undershirt  which is what i bought them for  i think they re probably a little thin to wear as a normal shirt they fit pretty well  and the price was right  these are probably the only undershirts i own now  i ve bought them a few times and they seem to be holding up well the v cut is just deep enough to stay hidden  under a button up shirt      
266,3.0,                       rather disappointed in material not even close to fruit of loom if your looking for a nice material and great comfortable feeling nothing comes close to hanbro      
267,5.0,                       while you can still use it as an undershirt but it s as thick as any other shirt you can find in florida so my husband has decided to uses these as regular tshirts     
268,5.0,                       i wear these at work as an undershirt  and they are fantastic  just a general white v neck t shirt  the tags are printed so you don t have to worry about them popping up throughout the day  and they re ultra comfortable  very good product      
269,5.0,                       great breathablequality fabricdurablefits great     
270,5.0,                       you can t beat the price for the number of shirts included in these packs  i like that the shirts do not have sewn in tags and they are printed on the fabric and they hold up very well with daily use  the only recommendation i would make is to wash them i cold water and don t dry them on the highest heat seating  this will prevent them from shrinking quickly over time      
271,5.0,                       my favorite purchase this year  comfortable  fits me well    colors so i can literally wear one each weekday  downside is the neck feels a tad big but it s not loose or too open  can see myself buying again or recommending to friends      
272,5.0,                       i buy these regularly   they work as expected   price is good   made in honduras  not china       
273,1.0,                       cheap material  already a hole in one shirt after the second time wearing it      
274,1.0,                       i read the reviews here and felt confident that the shirt would not shrink too much  after washing  the length of the t shirt decreased by almost     unacceptable  i wore it once after washing and it kept untucking all day long at work  if you like longer t shirts and you re around    tall  don t bother with these      
275,5.0,                       the t shirts sizes are accurate  fit is perfect  ordered size xl  has just the right amount of room  does not cling  great price    shirts are soft and comfortable  colors are accurate  i recommend this t shirts           
276,2.0,                       loved it until i washed it  comfortable when new  shirt shrunk   sizes in the wash  now its a midriff buy   sizes larger than you are      
277,4.0,                       shirts get loose ss day progresses  i wash in woolite dark and cold water and they still fade pretty quickly     
278,4.0,                       i bought   packages of     all fit as expected with no apparent holes or seem tears   collars are comfortable which can be an issue for me with other brands   a few loose threads here and there but nothing major   they will stretch some but i have come to expect that over years of wearing cotton t shirts      
279,3.0,                       please understand after    years t shirts eg  i totally understand about pure cotton fabric shrinkage and the water temp this fabric needs to be washed in and  what hit drying may do to the fabric these are fine quality shirts  and the fit well out of the package but they shrank to an uncomfortable length after   washings  i already have ordered the    extra large but  i would need a    xl  to maintain enough length after washing  unfortunately  amazon didn t offer a    xl       
280,5.0,                       i ve purchased before   nice  white v neck tshirt is soft  looks clean  fresh   i bought   size up  for shrinkage   dry them on delicate  low heat   last a long time if properly treated   if they get ruined  they re affordable to replace   i recommend this product     
281,5.0,                       great product  well made  soft and very comfortable  would purchase again      
282,5.0,                       it was a good buy great for the price the v is a little lower than i expected but it didn t hurt just wore them less than i thought     
283,1.0,                       totally looses shape after first wash  neck expands  bottom of shirts curl up  color fades   you get what you pay for        shirt      
284,1.0,                       the product description clearly states that this was supposed to be a five pack of shirts and i got a four pack  shirts are fine i m sure as far as fit and feel  but f    gildan for the false advertising to make a quick buck  fix the item description       
285,2.0,                       there s a reason   shirts are less than      these are plain ol       cotton shirts  when i purchased them the term  stretch  was in the description  but i don t see it there now  they shrunk a ton after i washed them  and will now be shop rags for me  if your idea of  moisture wicking  is      cotton  and you are good with a large shrink level after the first washing  on cold setting  have at it      
286,4.0,                       great shirt but runs a little big was hoping it would shrink once i washed it and it did just not enough  will buy again just a size smaller  i wear a xl but will order a large      
287,1.0,                       this is a very very cheap shirtthis is not a vneckthis v next is way to longthe shirt is baggyvery thin not happy with this shirt at allwouldn t buy again     
288,4.0,                       these are seconds  they are fine but they have some flaws  one had a couple small holes  one had a seam the wasn t quite closed      
289,3.0,                       they are kinda cheap feeling but fit well  i bought them as quarantine jammies so i m happy for the price  not at all comparable to the calvin klein shirts i was stealing from my hubby  but they are soooo affordable you cant really be upset      
290,3.0,                       i always wear a large  these were like a x large and the v neck hole is very big  would not order again      
291,4.0,                       i got these originally for my man but with them being much bigger then we expected i wear them around the house on our lazy days  they are comfortable  just not true to size      
292,3.0,                       these shirts come straight out the dry wrinkled very very badly  like standing there waiting for dryer to turn off straight out the dry wrinkled bad  i would buy again but other than that that s my only complaint  if you buy these shirts you better be prepared to iron them      
293,2.0,                       i wear a women s medium so i bought a men s medium thinking it would be loose and comfy but no the mens medium fit smaller than a woman s medium they r not that soft and shrink even more after washed     
294,5.0,                       perfect for at home daily wear  night wear also      
295,2.0,                       like  cheap   i bought these basicly as expendendable to wear over my surgical device during recovery from rotator cuff surgery  they surved the purpose  oversized for me as intended dislike  thin cheap material  but it didn t matter for my purpose   wouldn t buy for ordinary wear     
296,5.0,                       a little itchy at first  give them a few washes and they re nice and soft   v neck could stand to plunge a bit more as it can show depending on what shirt you re wearing over it      
297,2.0,                       too wide  had to return  not sure if we got a defective package but the large was more like an xxl wide fit colors are pretty though      
298,2.0,                       very poor quality  these shirts are made with very cheap material  they are stiff and uncomfortable and they shrunk after one wash on cold and a low tumble dry  these shirts do not look or fit like the products shown in the pictures  they are boxy at the waist  the arm holes are way too big  and the material is not form fitting whatsoever  spend a few extra dollars to get a higher quality shirt that won t bunch up under your overshirt      
299,5.0,                       i only wear black t shirt s as a shirt  no labels or logos  simple  under blazers  to workout   this is it  hanes gets ratchety  the loom just fits wrong  gildan material and construction is quality  comfort  even after washing and drying  is terrific  colorfastness lasts  get em      
300,5.0,                       i love to wear these during my workouts  very comfortable i read on other reviews that the size run bigger  so i order   size smaller and it was a great fit for me as a lady      
301,5.0,                       always glad to have  at least  some kind of   loose fit   very glad with this fit at  ft   goes past my waist   great offer       
302,5.0,                       i m very happy with these v neck t shirts  the fit and feel is the best of any brand i own  the fabric feels substantial and after several washings is still like new      
303,5.0,                       photo reference  shirt size large         lbs    weeks postpartum  nursing    c   dd hubby           lbsso i bought my husband these because i keep wearing his shirts to hide the baby pooch and they fit us both perfectly  i loved the light grey a lot more than i thought  we sweat quite a bit when anything is slightly humid and we just moved from utah to texas so we re sweating like pigs    i don t like sweat marks or to see sweat in the clothes i wear and in the light grey it was loose enough on me that i didn t have any sweat marks      
304,5.0,                       my husband wears medium  so i bought medium  they fit him just perfect  he s happy with them  so i m happy with them  would definitely recommend october   i bought a set for myself  so comfortable  wearing these men s shirt as of now      
305,5.0,                       purchased these plain white v neck t shirts to make tie dye shirts  they are a good weight for our florida weather    not too thin  not too thick  i saw some people concerned that they received opened packages  mine was completely sealed and never opened  the shirts are good quality  seams look well sewn and they washed well  i m sure they will hold up for many washings  would definitely purchase again      
306,5.0,                       good value       cotton  did not shrink after cold wash  size is true   finally a product to keep and not return  got to give this a five stars   just ordered the second package of these t shirts      
307,3.0,                       i bought these as i wanted a v neck that has a very shallow v   the pics of this shirt make it look quite shallow  and while it s definitely shallower than some  it s still pretty deep   my wife says it makes me look like i m wearing scrubs   if these necks were an inch or two shallower  i d love it  but it just looks funny on me      
308,5.0,                       i m a      woman but i looove these t shirts   nice quality  flattering fit   highly recommended      
309,5.0,                       i purchased these as sleep shirts  i usually use white ones but i am terrible about dropping food on my front  i got these practically overnight  they are true to size  and well made  i expect they will last me a long time  nice selection of colors  great price      
310,4.0,                       only complaint i have is they run bigger so i minus   star because of that but otherwise i love them and so does my wife    was a good price for all         
311,3.0,                       these were not quite true to size  i got large  which is what i always get  but it seems for this style v neck shirt i should have opted for xl  other than that a really nice t shirt     
312,4.0,                       i m        lb and i got a m but when i wash the shirts shrink so get one side bigger or to size  is great material feels great on your skin      
313,5.0,                       really like the product but large was a little too large so moved down to medium and am very satisfied      
314,5.0,                       i bought these for my adult son because the initial price was great  they were      cotton and it s always nice to have extra t shirts during the summer   he loved them and i ve since ordered them several more times      
315,5.0,                       love these shirts   i like the length and softness  i can sleep in them or wear them out and about  very comfortable disclaimer  i m female     
316,3.0,                       wanted these for undershirts for work  to boxy to fit well under a polo or button up  the set i recieved was thicker cotton  pretty soft    has a seam hole in it  was easy fix but brand new        
317,5.0,                       i got theses for my son to wear under his uniform  they work great and since there are black you do not see any stains  he works as an assistant to a mechanic so he gets really dirty  i wash them weekly and hang to dry and so far they are holding up good      
318,3.0,                       wanted a cool sun reflecting shirt to use as outerwear  and these t shirts do that but i never owned a t shirt that requires ironing  guess i should have purchased something with a little synthetic in them to be less wrinkled  they seem of good quality otherwise  not recommended except strictly as undershirt      
319,1.0,                       first time i followed reviews over experience and i failed  those shirts had way more great reviews compare to the amazon essential shirts  that s the reason why i bought them  i use undershirts almost every day for work purposes and decided to give those a try  instead getting the amazon essential shirts agin  which i already have and love  big mistake  those shirts are not even close as soft as all other shirts i had before  calvin klein  tommy hilfiger  amazon essential  nautica etc    not comfy because the material is not soft at all  wouldn t recommend them      
320,3.0,                       so far  not a bad shirt  but just not as expected  i thought it would be mor body hugging and a different touch feel  more in line with the    degrees brand  we will see how they hold up in the wash  but the shirt is a little looser than expect for a large      
321,5.0,                       x large is usually very loose fitting  after washing  these fit perfect and very comfortable      
322,4.0,                       gildan is an excellent brand  and their simple yet stylish v neck sets any guy apart with a look of rugged intrigue   over time  a couple months of wear  the sleeves stretch a bit and get loose around the arms  but otherwise for the price and quantity it s a great product      
323,1.0,                       the shirts shrunk considerably making the xl undesirable fits i would recommend you never wash them to keep their length or simply buy from someone else my grade  c minus      
324,4.0,                       i cannot stand most women s t shirts because they are too thin or have weird sleeves  i needed something to just wear around the house  i m           lbs and flat chested  another reason for liking men s tees  i purposely ordered xxl because i wanted big  i could have went with l for a snug  but not too snug fit  only con  the black seems to attract more hair and fuzzy things than other black shirts i own  i would buy again      
325,4.0,                       nice material and looks good enough to wear under a long sleeve shirt for later look it even alone  could be with as under shirts as well      
326,5.0,                       i m       floating at around just under    lbs the sleeves are short on me  slightly below my shoulder  other than that  soft and comfy      
327,3.0,                         stars because of how these fit i m      weigh about     lbs  and wear a    waist  i ordered medium  these shirts were huge out of the package  gave em all a wash and dried em on  high heat   they shrank up quite a bit  which is what i wanted  but the length is now up close to my waist  and the width seems to be tailored more for heavier set midsections  pretty baggy shirts even after the high dry the quality is definitely   stars for the price and i did receive a total of   shirts  if i were to buy these again  i d probably order small and refrain from throwing em in the dryer      
328,5.0,                       i look for      cotton for softness of fabric and moisture absorbancy     
329,2.0,                       only one of the shirts has polyester in it  which was disappointing  the v neck opening is much larger than i expected  they are okay as regular v necks  nothing special      
330,5.0,                       these are great quality and very comfortable  they fit perfectly and maintained the same fit and shape after washing and drying      
331,5.0,                       really just as good as the better known brands but more reasonably priced   i ve bought a few of these packs      
332,5.0,                       i bought these for work shirts  they are soft and comfy  did not shrink in dryer  cleans up perfect      
333,5.0,                       these are great shirts   i purchased them to do tie dye and they worked perfectly   they are not thin and are the same weight as a basic t shirt   i ordered small since i am a female   i am        approx     lbs and they fit great      
334,5.0,                       while traveling we encountered a seasonal change and suddenly needed summer t shirts    saw this incredible bargain on amazon    for       and ordered them  quality cotton fabric no skew in stitching  no tags to cut out and after two washes they retain their colour  a trim fit and lining on the v neck  could not be happier with my purchased      
335,2.0,                       don t waste your money unless you plan to wear these in to paint  the material quality is poor and inferior to other shirts in similar price ranges  body of shirt swallows mw  shoulders are too narrow and sleeves do not make it ti mid biceps  i m sticking with my next level brand      
336,3.0,                       prewashed shirts on gentle cycle and the very first shirt and very first day  it had a small hole in it  i thought the quality would be better than others  a big disappointment and i hope the other shirts aren t from the same machine as this one      
337,3.0,                       i m gonna be fair here and say it s a decent tee  but i usually buy the jockey brand  and i get the large and then it shrinks to sort of a m l  which is perfect for weekends  so i ordered these expecting the same thing  but these don t shrink  so i m swimming in them  i suppose you could say that s a good thing and if you need a really large fitting tee this is the one to get  but if you are expecting some shrinkage  don t buy      
338,5.0,                       fit is about right  my wife says she likes these on me better than the banana republic ones i normally buy    of the shirts are black  which i should ve caught before buying  they look nice  just didn t need   of them      
339,2.0,                       the material seems to be good quality  the v neck is way too low and the sleeves are a bit odd and large      
340,1.0,                       major inconsistencies from all   shirts  most noticeable was the  v   which isn t centered  the  v  also drops down way too low wherein my inner collarbone is completely exposed  i was hoping that after washing it would slightly shrink to fit better   all it did was shrink the length of the  already super short  sleeves      
341,5.0,                       i m   ft about    lb     inch chest and the xxl is a perfect fit these are a well made  nice fit  lighter weight t shirt that s hard to beat for the price  i live in so cal and i really like the light weight of these t shirts  but if you live in the more northern areas for layering in cold weather  your preferences may be for a heather weight shirt      
342,3.0,                       compared to other shirts i have the fabric seems more on the economy scale   thought i would try them but now will probably go back to the ones i bought somewhere else   they ll be ok  cause i wear them under neath my uniform  but i was looking for a higher quality      
343,5.0,                       well made   especially arms   nice construction and length for men or women      
344,4.0,                       you can t argue with the price  at first  i was hesitant on buying it because there seem to be a lot of negative reviews  but i purchase it nonetheless  i m not sure if they ve improved their quality control  or i just got a  good batch  but  i m glad i bought it  i had absolutely none of the problems that the reviews mentioned  holes  uneven sleeves  fabric unraveling  etc  the only issues i ve had is that it seemed a bit short after washing it  possibly due to shrinkage  it s also a bit loose around the waist  doesn t hug your waist as closely as other shirts  i think this that s because the material isn t too flexible  it doesn t really bounce back well aside from after having been washed   dried  it actually has a habit of rolling up slightly at the very end which almost makes me feel like i m wearing a crop top at times  maybe buying a size higher would be a fix for this  one thing i should also note is that they aren t all that soft  but you have to remember how much you re paying for it also  it doesn t have that finish that other companies are doing now to prevent it from picking up smells      
345,5.0,                       i have used hanes v neck t shirts for years   long enough to see a change in quality that s not good   so i decided to try a new v  neck   the gilman brand was not familiar  but it had good reviews   so i bought six   they came shortly after  washed and dried on hot to check shrinkage   good news   they fit as hoped with a long tail  and the material quality is grate   good thickness and soft      
346,5.0,                       these are amazing quality shirts for the money and nice and long for my tall husband we will be ordering more     
347,5.0,                       i usually get banana republic t shirts  these shirts are as good if not better and     of  the price  they are well constructed but soft and the fit is excellent      
348,3.0,                       nice  comfortable  larger than expected   will was and dry then reevaluate     
349,5.0,                       great quality for undershirts or printing  very happy for price cannot be beat  did not shrink much in first wash  i ordered size small  was true to fit     
350,3.0,                       what do i dislike about this product    the neckline  about a shirt that should fit around a mans neck and not seem like a blouse  it is also to long or  for a tall person  not a normal size after washing all five of them so that i can t return them what i like is that the fabric is soft   but i think that they used the wrong direction in the shirt fabric maybe i got a bad batch      
351,5.0,                       the shirts are great for the money i got them for my dad for christmas because that s all he wears     
352,3.0,                       advertises   pack but definitely only came with   shirts  two black  one white  one grey  not pleased      
353,5.0,                       i hate tight fitting shirts  i wanted them large enough incase of shrinkage  which was very little      
354,5.0,                       very good quality and a value   sizing was a guess on my part   i thought these would shrink all over   the length did a bit but the upper part of the tee shirts didn t   i will probably order more in my regular size      
355,4.0,                       i got these cheap  you can t beat the price for v necks  right  and gildan is a known brand in t shirts  so i took a chance  they are average shirts in quality  and i wear them around the house or under sweaters  one thing i wish they would do    the v necks are wider than my other v neck shirts      
356,5.0,                       walmart discontinued gildan recently and i tried their george house brand   i tried   and returned the whole bag    then i found the gildan t shirts on amazon   much better   great t shirt fit and feel      
357,5.0,                       these t shirts are well made and fit perfectly will re order when ready      
358,3.0,                       don t get me wrong  i am not saying not to buy these t shirts  just know that when you get   t shirts for       well they are not exactly top shelf  i bought these as an experiment having purchased gildan before  bought extra heavy t shirts and they were great  and thinking maybe these might be about the same quality  not the same cotton is pretty thin  neck opening seems a little large and sleeves seem a little short  fit about right  i like my shirts a little snug but i know what is too tight     black    light grey and   dark grey  the back shoulder seam on the light grey came apart after just a few hours of wearing  i was not doing anything strenuous  going to keep these as work shirts      
359,1.0,                       these shirts have a terrible cut and the material feels coarse  i will be buying something else and pitching these out      
360,3.0,                       i feel like these are a great price  very comfortable  and fit great  they wear well under my dress shirts for work  that being said  after the first wash  i received these yesterday   a hole was already in one of my shirts  a little disappointing  and as i now see is a known issue  i hope the manufacturer see these and takes note  quality is important too  probably will not buy again if this appears to be common issue      
361,5.0,                       i ordered these for sleep shirts  but they re nice enough to wear out  and look pretty good too  these are a very good value  i think they will be fine even after a trip through the wash  i m happy      
362,5.0,                       comfortable and not too tight like so many brands today     
363,4.0,                       i give it   stars for the price   however not cotton and runs tight   i bought another pack and bought a size up   i should have returned these because they were tooo small      
364,5.0,                       great old school type of t shirt  soft cotton  and not thin like most tshirts these days  love them      
365,5.0,                       i m     lbs       but i do strength training so i do have a muscular chest and upper build  not very big though  but noticeable   this shirt in large fits just perfect  it is a bit longer than i expected but it s fine when you sit down  won t roll up at all  it s not toooo long  but i just tuck the extra part to the small right pocket  my style      
366,5.0,                       you can wear these t shirts anywhere  running errands  lounging at home or working in yard   material breathes and very comfortable   truly wash   wear  no ironing needed      
367,3.0,                       the material was okay feeling and probably would get softer over time  but the sleeves are hilariously wide  i cannot see wearing these without being uncomfortable  returned  for some reason had no option to return with a code to the ups store  had to jump through hoops to print the label  thankfully my ups store could take care of it  i hate the postal service      
368,5.0,                       great fit and surprisingly good material     
369,4.0,                       nice solid shirts      
370,4.0,                       mine are not bad  especially when you get   for       a slight bit rough right out of the package but fine after the first wash  which i do with all new clothing   they are on the cheaper made materials side but again not bad for the price   good work shirt   i m satisfied with the purchase      
371,1.0,                       material ok  length ok  but this item top part is a complete disaster  the v is huge the sleeves are tiny the shoulders seams are for medium   the distance between the neck and the shoulder seam   so when you wear it the sleeves  pop out to the sides since there is no enough length in the overall upper part very bad design  i don t know who can wear it comfortably  the v is big  so it go down to middle of your torso      
372,1.0,                       if i could leave zero stars as a review  i would  every single shirt folded up at the hip seam after the first wash  looks terrible  and even after using an iron  the shirt seams will not lay flat furthermore  the shirts have a very poor fit  the shirt is shaped like a bell  perhaps i ordered a muumuu by mistake  i am       and    lbs  with a normal build  it is inches wider at the hip  then the chest terrible stitching  terrible fit  terrible buy      
373,5.0,                       so often clothing bought on line does not fit right  these fit just like i wanted them to   sleeve length is perfect and well as the overall length  not binding but a nice relaxed fit      
374,5.0,                       son comodas  se desti en rapido  pero para lo que cuesta si lo vale      
375,5.0,                       highly recommend  i m female           lbs  i bought these to wear as casual tshirts  womens tshirts are made too stretchy   thin  these shipped fast  are tagless  soft material  hang just above my butt   didn t shrink in the wash  i bought men s adult small   they fit perfect on a chubby figure  ddd chest      
376,1.0,                       fabric is of very poor quality   cotton is rough and very uncomfortable against the skin  cut of the shirt is very odd as well as it doesn t conform to the body at all  small through the chest  large at the bottom  with big arm holes  just weird      
377,5.0,                       my husband is      and    lbs or so  tall and lean  but a tiny bit of a dad bod  the xl is about as tight as he d wear a shirt after we washed and dried it  it looks great  but definitely wouldn t want it any tighter  some shirts he can wear a large in  but this shirt was best to error on the larger side  glad we did  but he looks great in it  and you can t really beat the quantity for the price  good quality too  he wears basic tees like this every day  so we ll be buying new ones in a few months i m sure  as they naturally wear down from washing so frequently      
378,3.0,                       v neck seen in image looks smaller than what i received  neck part does not fit as i expected  i like my urban pipeline ultimate tee v neck and some other t shirts i bought from costco  obviously both other t s cost about   to   times more than each of this      
379,2.0,                       all of these t shirts literally track sweat as if you are being sprayed with a water bottle  i don t have issues with excessive sweating  but even being out in the sun for    minutes the other day  it looked as if someone dumped a bucket of water on me  it was gross  and i was so embarrassed      
380,5.0,                       husband love the material and the fit   what makes him happy  makes me happy      
381,1.0,                       ordered these july  th      they seemed okay for the price about     at the time  a couple months later they have tiny holes at the bottom and they are various lengths despite being the same size  i wouldn t recommend these  they stretch in odd places and the v neck is deformed on some  they look like i purchased at a goodwill because of a bad batch  i bought these for work but they re better off as sleeping shirts  i won t purchase again  very disappointed      
382,5.0,                       definitely a buy in my opinion  cost and quality are perfect     
383,3.0,                       i had ordered this same item in a different size and was very satisfied with the product  i reordered but in a smaller size  the fit is ok but the material is different and the hems roll up on the sleeves and the bottom      
384,5.0,                       i ordered for myself as a female to add iron on logo of my work business  i love the fact that they are breathable fabric  lightweight and not thin and not thick just right      
385,5.0,                       got these shirts for my teenager to use under his practice pads for football  he s     and     lbs   extra large is a perfect fit for him  they shrunk a little bit  the very thick and durable  so far the color has not faded      
386,5.0,                       love these t shirts  excellent source of comfort during  these trying times       
387,5.0,                       these t s are great   price is a plus   they haven t shrunk in the couple of months that i ve worn them   i like that they are a little longer than standard t shirts which helps keep it tucked in   highly recommend      
388,1.0,                       i can t believe that more than       reviews with     stars are there for this     brought it two weeks back  washed once in washing machine and this is what happened  it feels rough       cotton though        
389,5.0,                       boyfriend wears them all the time for work  he loves them  they hold up nicely and don t shrink      
390,4.0,                       basic square shirt  photo was misleading  this shirt would never outline your chest like stretchy form fitting shirt would  it s the most basic shirt  like the one you get from doing a blood drive donation  it s not slim  it s not at all for people who actually looking for a good looking v shirt  it s just a wash your car kinda shirt after   months of owning them i  ing from   stars to    im completely satisfied  especially after seeing the price again  i wear them every day around the house  i still keep my opinion  they re not as form fitting as you d think     
391,4.0,                       comfy  but the colors are very cheap looking and fade fast      
392,2.0,                       the shirts were a bit large so i washed them in hot water to shrink them  and they ended up alright  the main problem i have with these shirts is the v is too deep  i hoped that shrinking it would solve that problem  but it didn t  the material is soft and thicker than i expected  which is nice  but the deep v really ruins it for me      
393,5.0,                       brought as a gift for my husband  complements the jogging suits i brought him  great fit      
394,5.0,                       these are just what i needed  quality      
395,5.0,                       i bought these because i did not want to pay    bucks for a single vee neck tee from the women s section  great deal  i bought the shirts big to cover my butt  a pair of leggings and cute boots     done      
396,5.0,                       great v neck undershirts in a multipack   was surprised to get an extra shirt   best thing about the gildan is the higher v neck opening as opposed to the fruit of the loom which has a deeper v neck opening   both have their place depending on the dress shirt i m wearing      
397,5.0,                       this is an excellent product of excellent material at an excellent price the cotton is soft of good quality the fit is perfect i use mine to work in and they are perfect for this i appreciate the value because for the price vs quantity this is the best      
398,3.0,                       the reason i gave the three stars on overall rating is as follows   on two shirts the right side of the neckline is improperly cut   this causes the neckline to have too much material on that side and it refuses to lie flat   i found this to be the same on some of the white tee shirts i purchased for my husband   this is a problem with the shirts even purchased in stores   only some of the shirts do not lie flat   we do like the quality and the price   colors are nice too all and all  just a flaw that we overlook but others may not      
399,5.0,                       i like it  well packed  it suits me well although after washing it shrunk a bit  but it s okay  inexpensive price  good quality for the price and fast shipping  i recommend these t shirts this items took too long to arrive with prime membership    days   don t buy it      
400,5.0,                       es perfecto pero me parece que las tallas no estan bien  primero quedaron chicos y despues muy grandes  pero con la la talla perfecta es una camiseta muy buena     
401,2.0,                       the good  very cheap shirtsthe bad  very inconsistent  they run large but shrink a lot in the dryer  the v neck is a very deep v  these will soak up the sweat like a sponge    and hold it there all day  maybe thats what they mean by moisture wicking      
402,3.0,                       individually  the shirts are as expected  however  i ordered  as described  the     pack yet i received a     pack in a package that states     pack  the     pack had an off white looking one that i did not receive      
403,5.0,                       i bought these to wear around the house  they are comfortable  and since they are v neck i dont have that being choked feeling like i do with regular  crew neck t shirts  i m a woman with a big chest and dont like tight fitting t shirts  i like comfort and these do the trick  i didn t  have the chemical scent or the shrinkage as some other reviewers experienced   these t shirts are definitely  a great deal and good quality  they wash great       
404,2.0,                       i m   r  active male  i like my t shirts to be more form fitting  i ve been wearing large t shirts my whole life  i was swimming in these things  i tried to wash and shrink them down  but my wife still joked it looked i was wearing my father s old t shirt  they seriously felt a full size too big   maybe good for sleeping in  but nothing else      
405,2.0,                       very disappointed with the tshirts   i was under the impression that the t shirts would be somewhat fitted and thick enough to wear with shorts or jeans   they are very wide and they are  very thin once you wash them   essentially   they are undershirts   i would not recommend them      
406,5.0,                       a little shrink on  st wash  then that s the size you get  not see through  i wear all white  if you have a fit body you will love these t s  i m    yrs old     yr gym rat   look good for my age  i v earned it               waist    can t beat the price and that clean cotton feel        
407,3.0,                       you can t beat the price  however  i will caution people that the material is terrible  it looks shabby when worn and after my initial wash of the shirts  i found holes on two of the shirts  one is better off ordering a hanes or a fruit of the loom for a similar price that comes in two or three items   i intend to get a refund for these t shirts      
408,3.0,                       nothing special here  unlike many users reported  i did receive a   pack  the material isn t very high quality and i don t like that there is no seem on the side  as a result it hangs a bit awkwardly and isn t a very fitted look  but for     what do you really expect  i still wear it and it s fine however if you re looking for quality v necks i d probably recommend you look some where else and spend a little more doe      
409,5.0,                       very soft and comfortable  looked big when i took it out of the package  but they fit perfect  fabric is much softer than hanes or fruit of the loom brands      
410,2.0,                       in comparison to the other brand of vnecks that i ordered  these got thrown in the trunk or given to someone who needed a shirt  there s nothing wrong with them  they are jst too heavy and ridged a fit for me  i have a hard time wearing clothes that constantly remind me im wearing clothes      
411,5.0,                       very happy with purchase  ordered the  xl and they are not tight  thankfully   hard to find a big and tall t shirt and i think i ve got my  go to  shirt from now on  well made  medium density and the fit is perfect  not baggy blousy and there is a proper hang  meaning it doesn t hang short at the belt line       
412,2.0,                       the only one long enough was the light grey  the rest shrunk up like belly button shirts      
413,1.0,                       these shirts arrived unbelievably large  a size large is much larger than a large in any other brand like j  crew  gap  prana  patagonia  any of target s brands  etc i washed them on cold  and then the absolute lowest setting on my dryer  the shirts shrunk to be about the size of a j  crew medium  despite being exposed to virtually no heat  and cold water   i can t imagine what will happen when i wash them next   but  what s really crazy is the differences in each shirt   i had to throw one shirt away immediately after washing  because it was  no exaggeration     shorter than the other shirts   it came down to above my belly button   none of the shirts are symmetrical  and none of them fit or are sewn the same as the other shirts   i assume these are hand made by people that are new to garment sewing  there are odd skipped and uneven stitches  which is something i ve never noticed in any other factory produced garment  on top of all of this  these are paper thin shirts   wearing the white shirt as an undershirt under a plain white button up  and you can see right through both shirts  these are definitely not appropriate shirts to wear on their own i ll be using these as undershirts  but i m never buying anything from this brand again   i have shirts from other inexpensive brands that were just a little more expensive that are far better in both fit and quality      
414,5.0,                       love these t shirt  excellent quality and price  i buy these for sleep shirts and these were better quality than the hanes  they aren t too thin and the package came with light gray instead of white  i am pleased  very good deal  thank you     
415,4.0,                       i was looking for simple v neck under shirt for winter time  i just got them and don t know how that look after laundry  thay quality don t look good as fruit of the loom but stil nice  i have ordered xl but it s a little bit big  but it is still good  hoop thay will shrink after laundry      
416,2.0,                       these are not soft at all other than the light grey one  all the others are super stiff and itchy and that is after washing a few times with plenty of fabric softener  so these will be throw away for me and even though they are a good price  i should have put that money towards a brand i know is soft      
417,3.0,                       i order the small as i was planning on using them as undershirts  but they were way to small for me fabric feels cheap      
418,5.0,                       the product fit my brother just right he liked them alot he said they were very comfortable    and the softness was the best           
419,2.0,                       material far to coarse  especially for sensitive skin  i washed them twice with softeners  but could not tell much difference  they shrink down one size  i ordered xxl instead of xl it is very hard to find soft blended cotton material  especially for older and sensitive skin  i ve tried several brands from amazon with pretty much the same results  the best alternative for sensitive skin are cool spandex shirts      
420,4.0,                       a great value at a great price    colored vs neck tees for under     bucks  rating would be   star if it were an assortment of colors       
421,1.0,                       i put the shirts in the washer right out of the packaging     shirt came out with a sizable hole in the underarm  and another looks like it has loose stitching at the  v  in the neck   the shirts look like they d fit well  bit i m not taking the chance that the others will fall apart too   returning for a refund      
422,4.0,                       i have not washed them yet but if they do not shrink to much  i will be very pleased and buy some more of them in different colors   i will update this if they shrink alot      
423,3.0,                       haines was my brand  i m looking for better quality and reasonable price  i bought    of these good but falls short  they are thicker and have a good feel  the problem is the sowing  two shirts sleeves came partially off  therefore i had   arm holes on them    other shirt developed small hole that grows each time i wash it  so out of    shirts   have gone bad after   or   washings  i read the other reviews so i purchased them  i wonder how quickly the reviews were written and how many time the shirts were washed  they are a little large but comfortable and soft  however i think it will be short lived  we will see  after   weeks of use of    shirts     are unwearable  make your own decision  if you find a black v neck that better let know     
424,3.0,                                lbsi m at the size where sometimes i fit a small and sometimes i fit a medium  i check the measurements chart was exactly between small medium and read that if unsure get one size up  fair enough  it runs a little big for a medium so i was hoping that a good wash will make it perfect this shirt shrunk a lot on medium low heat   before washing  the length was perfect but the width was slightly too large  after the wash the length shrunk by almost two inches and the width shrunk by about one inch  i love the width  arms  and neck after the wash but the length shrunk too much that it can easily show my stomach when i raise my arms stuck with air drying it and having it a bit oversized or drying it and having it fit perfect except for the length      
425,5.0,                       for the price     you cannot beat the quality  they wash and dry without shrinkage    i bought this item   i bought   of the all white   and      of the all black     total  and very pleased   large and i am    ft      ibs      
426,5.0,                       i got these for my son and boyfriend for christmas neither are fans of v neck shirts but they actually wear these ones  they re soft and comfortable  they can be worn as undershirts or just as a shirt to go out in     
427,5.0,                       as an older woman with sagging triceps and broad shoulders i abhor cap sleeves and prefer mens t shirts with their full sleeves  especially under a sweater or out doing yard work  these are soft and comfortable      
428,5.0,                       after waiting nearly   months to receive these shirts  i ordered at the end of may  the order was cancelled because they said they no longer had them in stock  then i got an email saying they were back in so i reordered  they still took forever but i finally received them yesterday   the reason i needed these is because my husband is a diesel mechanic and he really likes the v necks so they aren t  choking  him while he is moving around under the trucksand i like the darker colors for stain purposes   he does have some of these already and they wash up really nice     
429,5.0,                       i m gonna copy paste this  these are awesome and i want more  i m doubling the review because i bought the wrong size  xl  and had to give those to my gf for pajamas and get the shmediums      
430,5.0,                       far better than fruit ot loom and almost as good as hanes  i wear these to bed only as i can t stand anything restricting my neck  this is my second purchase of the brand and the first set has held up well for    years  i also wear them in the house and yard doing chores  they re not something i d wear out on the town and they re not designed for that purpose  medium weight i would say and not flimsy      
431,2.0,                       the shirts  despite other reviews  are very short  much shorter than hanes comfort soft by at least an inch  they are cut too boxy and the v neck is extremely wide and not centered  i like plain shirts  i like inexpensive stuff  i ve worn hanes soft style until there vneck style changed about a year ago  its too deep now   i wear anvil  next level and tultex  these in no way compare to any  just to make sure i wasn t crazy i went and bought regular hanes soft style to compare  no comparison  these gildan shirts are trash  which is a shame because i really wanted to like them      
432,4.0,                       i ordered this when it was    for a pack of xl  which for any tshirt pack  that is a steal  i ve worn the black one so far and i do like it  there s only a couple of  concerns      it is a little big especially in the sleeve area  i haven t washed these yet  but i plan to see if they shrink some     the black shirts tent to grab lint these will be shirts that you ll probably have to keep  brushing  to avoid all the lint i like the length of the collar  it s very nice  and not too close to my neck  i think this product is a way to go if you want something affordable i think all in all  i like them      
433,5.0,                       it took forever to get this product  but once it arrived it was worth the wait  i have been always hesitant when purchasing apparel over the internet due to the weird sizing that all companies have  this was a great first experience  i will be ordering another set  hopefully it gets here before the the end of the year      
434,4.0,                       the v neck area felt to loose and hangs to low even after washing it  the black is not dark but dull  there ok for pjs or something  i had large i m             
435,3.0,                       rarely write review but do this one  material no good  don t feel comfortable to wear it  i am always the dkny t shirt but gave this a chance and turned out no good  i ordered over    i think but will not wear them  i am         lbs athletic body  i got small tight at arm pit area other ok but not comfy      
436,2.0,                       like every other undershirt i ve bought in the past ten years   garbage  they shrink in wash  they get stretched out after one wear  the v neck is literally rolled over on itself  they cost like    cents to manufacture and they sell for like    a shirt  whatta racquet     
437,1.0,                       decent gildan quality  as always and fit comfort is fine  however  maybe i m just getting old  but i remember when v necks weren t cut so low that you could basically see nipples  the neck is cut way too deep  like i said  maybe that s the style now and i m getting old  but i ve not been able to find a v neck that wasn t built for rock stars or hipsters in about a decade      
438,4.0,                       the shirts are really made strong and soft      
439,5.0,                       nice shirts  look great  feel great  these have been through several washes already  and have not shrunk like some of the other people had happen to them  i do wash them in cold water  the price is great for what you are buying  and i would recommend these shirts      
440,5.0,                       boyfriend loved the fit of these t shirts  bought an xl because he prefers them loose  and he was delighted with overall fit and fabric       cotton    he recommends them      
441,5.0,                       i ordered the extra large because that s what i wanted   they fit to size and are very comfortable and well made      
442,4.0,                       i m        and i weigh     lbs  i bought these because the large size fits like a parachute  the shirt seems like it will last a while  they shrink a lot even when washed in cold water and dried on low  they really only shrink in the length      
443,4.0,                       just regular old black v neck shirts  i prefer to wear white or black v necks to keep everything simple day to day  these do the job  not amazing but not terrible  solid shirt      
444,5.0,                       my husband really likes these gildan v neck t shirts   the fit is perfect   has in the past used hanes brand v neck t shirts   he very much prefers the gildan brand for the fit and the feel      
445,5.0,                       i was originally worried about ordering clothes online   however  after reading so many positive reviews i thought i should try   great fit   i am      and      ordered  xl and very happy   fits great and no tags   great buy      
446,5.0,                       i needed a few budget friendly      cotton t shirts for the gym   casual outwear  originally  i was planning to buy some alphalete or gymshark but i didn t wanted to spend too much since i ll have to wear xl in the future  so i settled down with these instead with that being said  i wasn t expecting too much in terms of quality since it s dirt cheap  paid     for   t shirts  so       per t shirt  but i gotta say i m fairly impressed  if the quality of the t shirt remains the same in   months to a year  i ll most likely buy another pack in the future      
447,2.0,                       i am just shy of      which makes me below average in height in the us  the t shirts are too short to be tucked in unless you are willing to always keep your hands at your side  i thought maybe i had gained too much weight over the last year but then i bought a   pack of van heusen undershirts at marshall s  the undershirts were over   inches longer than the gildan s  it felt so good to have a shirt that i didn t have to worry about  i just bought fruit of the loom  stay tucked  and they are more than   more inches longer than the van heusen  they are a dream  unless you want to rock a mid drift  i recommend another brand on a positive note  the shirts are well made and held up in extreme working conditions      
448,5.0,                       nice  soft light weight v neck t shirt  just what i needed      
449,3.0,                       i m          lbs  non athletic build with a minor beer belly everything about this purchase was convenient  for starters  the value of these shirts stood out for me  you re getting six      cotton v neck t shirts for under      although the fit  out of the bag  is slightly loose and long  i m sure over time and a few washes it ll shrink a little quality reflects the price in terms of the cut and softness of the shirts  higher end t shirts usually are soft and buttery from the start  these shirts aren t as soft  it s an average shirt but i see no negatives the speed and promptness of this order was exceptional  i ordered the shirts wednesday     am and they were delivered the next day  thursday  pm  shipping was free at any rate  i m satisfied with these shirts      
450,3.0,                       first thing i noticed was the  new smell  was too strong  the fabric is pretty thick and quite itchy  considering peoples  comments  i bought them   size smaller than my actual size  m to sm   they fit fine  but sleeves were a little tight and short  also vneck is quite large  i m         lbs if it helps      
451,5.0,                       this is my first experience with gildan t shirts  they came so highly recommended by our daughter  i just had to give them a try  the quality is excellent  as well as the fit  they are a very good choice  i have made the switch from hanes  and don t regret my decision on bit      
452,3.0,                       awkward fit  uncomfortable material  mistakenly thought these were platinum  it looks like they ll all be getting donated      
453,3.0,                       tried on t shirts fit perfect my wife washed them and after first washing they already have shrunk quite a bit  disappointed both the length and width shunk  why is it so hard to find t shirts that stay long so your crack is not showing if you bend over     
454,2.0,                       very soft great price very comfortable just not long enough if you buy  x they shrink up n leave your belly hanging out     
455,5.0,                       i needed t shirts   wanted a couple that weren t black  they are not thick like regular t shirts   that s also what i wanted  three black  one medium gray   one lighter gray  arrived some than expected  packaging was fine  recommend      
456,5.0,                       i ve worn these shirts for two years and recently bought a second pack  but the first set are still holding up fine  i line dry my t shirt s and am happy with the product as a whole      
457,1.0,                       pre laundry   the fit appears to be full cut  and not athletic as it appears pictured on amazon  fabric is soft and comfortable post laundry  washed in cold water  delicate cycle  dried in dryer  med setting the shirts are useless rags  extra wide and extra short   fabric is course  v neck is u neck   horrible purchase      
458,5.0,                       its hard to shop for my boss man  but i saw these on sale and got him them for work  they are long and durable material  they are soft and sometimes i even use them as a night gown  i love them as much as he does        
459,3.0,                       these fit okay but was disappointed with the neck opening  its very large and the neckline is too deep  not really what i was expecting from a v neck so probably won t order more  the quality is okay  very basic material this could be recommended as an upper layer for sleepwear but not really for wearing out  if you don t like a large neck opening on shirts you may not like these      
460,5.0,                       simply needed a v neck to wear under dress shirts for work   i like the v neck to reduce bulk around the neck when wearing a dress shirt and tie   these work great for that purpose   these are not wispy thin but have some thickness to them   i personally don t wear v necks by themselves  but these would be fine for somebody who does   i recommend them due to their functionality for my purpose and saving a few bucks in the process   i like that they are made in honduras      
461,1.0,                       i wouldn t recommend this product  it creates sooo much static cling and  even when so many dryer sheets are used  it still gets hair stuck to it  any small lint or fuzz that it comes into contact with sticks to it for eeeever  it s so annoying  i cannot recommend this to anyone that doesn t want to spend hours picking off all the hair off it or enjoys lint rolling their shirts every hour      
462,4.0,                       i ve used sun tees and gildan tees for a very long time  back in the day  over    years ago  they used to be very very thick and super durable quality  i guess just like everything else over time companies try to maximize profits by making things cheaper  dont get me wrong these tees still beat the haynes and other brands at durability and thickness  i still love these tees and will continue to buy them  back then i wore  x  now a  x fits me  i am stocky weighing       foot    good product     
463,4.0,                       love these shirts  they are my shirts for around the house  i bought them for the husband but he doesnt like v necks so i took them and use them for cleaning super comfortable      
464,3.0,                       when seeing the price of these i immediately purchased  this purchase is a prime example of you get what you pay for  tons of inconsistencies in quality and size  they also do not wash well so we only got two wears out of them      
465,1.0,                       these t shirts feel great however there are spots on them  don t know if it s machine oil or    need better quality control  waiting to hear from seller      
466,5.0,                       took these on a trip where i was very active  great to the simplify my wardrobe and cut down on packing when there is a variety of weather  great to layer  wear as pjs  or just wear by itself with leggings      
467,5.0,                       if you have a business and friends and family keep asking you to make things for free   this is perfect      
468,3.0,                       i live in florida where s it hot and humid  these shirts don t breathe and major sweating takes place in them      
469,1.0,                       don t waste your money on these  they are terribly cheap and the necks lose their shape after a single wash i literally received these less than a week ago  washed them with the hopes they d shrink a bit  and was disappointed to see the neck come out of the dryer wavy and not laying flat on every one of the six that came in the package i ve worn haynes v necks forever and should have stuck with what i know   oh well  at least i can make a bunch of shop rags out of these now      
470,5.0,                       you can t really tell from the picture but the v neck is deep  like just above my nip level  some people may like that but not my thing  check oh hanes nano for a smaller v they gave me a refund before sending them back so giving them   stars      
471,5.0,                       i needed new shirts for my husband since he recently lost some weight   i hesitated between the xxl and xl sizes   i ordered the xl and i m glad i did   they are nice and roomy and the v neck is not too deep   they are very soft as well   don t know how well they wash since i haven t done that yet      
472,5.0,                       bought these for my daughter to wear under her uniform top  she finds them to fit very well  and are soft and comfortable  they wash and wear very well  great purchase      
473,4.0,                       these are  value  tee shirts  less than    each  they did shrink a bit and are not heavy weight  very nice as an undershirt  however probably not as a shirt by itself  they will probably have a moderate wear life  but that is fine for me as colored tees of even very high quality fade after a while  i will definitely consider getting more depending on how these hold up      
474,3.0,                       you get what you pay for  and that is not said in a sarcastic manner  this product is fine for what it is designed for   that is  a very casual  around the house piece of apparel  i m certain it is fine for the beach and i guess under a real shirt  but i wouldn t use them for that purpose   the fit was also just ok  nothing to make any big noise about but don t expect the fit you d get with famous  name  brand  but then again  look at the price  as noted  it is fine for its purpose  i bought a bunch of them for the reasons i noted      
475,4.0,                       ordered xxl for my husband who is          lbs   normally he wears xxl in shirts   these were way too big   an xl would be better   nice quality tho   pretty thick   cozy feel   neck line was too low     
476,5.0,                       good quality   i used the size chart and they fit as expected   no washing yet  but i have had this brand in the past and those held up just fine  i plan to purchase another set      
477,4.0,                       great product for the price   fabric is not super heavy but i bought these for lounging around house and yard in hot summer weather  and the light weave and loose fit  i normally take l but ordered   sizes larger for the coolness and comfort    one seam was a little bit puckered at the armpit of sleeve but is a hardly noticeable cosmetic issue  especially since i cut the sleeves off these for added comfort      
478,1.0,                       advertised as a     pack  what i received was a     pack  this was false advertising at the fullest  would ask for a refund  but it s not worth it  amazon could do better      
479,5.0,                       i enjoy a good undershirt that s thin but still gives me room under my flannel shirts  this is exactly what i was looking for  i ve found this shirt before at walmart  however  it was usually in a   pack and came in black and grey  i was glad i found these in all black and a bigger pack  i ll probably order another pack soon so i have at least   for each day of the week      
480,5.0,                       husband really likes these shirts  he s an athletic build with bro s shoulders and bigger arms  the large fits nice  fitted  but not tight  and the length is just right  just below the belt   soft fabric too      
481,2.0,                       after washing and drying per instructions  the shirts shrank by   size  before washing  they fit as expected      
482,4.0,                       perfect in every way  except the arms fit tight in the shoulder pit area  i cannot imagine what strange body type this was designed for   lol     
483,5.0,                       good quality shirts for the price  gildan has never let me down as i have worn their brand for two decades now  these are great for the price and although the material is soft and light it isn t as uncomfortable as other brands  great for summer and for going out  they are big when you take them out of the package but after a few washes they go down to a normal size as expected with other name brands  you can t beat the price      
484,2.0,                       looked okay when pulling from package but i dried on low heat and it still shrunk to the size that becomes too small for me  would not suggest this vendor if you need a reliable specific size      
485,5.0,                       got the large and they fit like a typical undershirt  fit loose and the length goes   inches below the belt  if you want a tight fit get the medium  they are cotton so they did shrink about          
486,1.0,                       out of the box the shirts appeared ok  little short for shirts that were supposed to be big and tall  after one wash  they shrunk up to the equivalent of an xl  these were big and tall  xxl  the price was reasonable  but again   shrunk considerably after one wash      
487,5.0,                       i love these on my husband and have purchased them a few times  he works very hard and they hold up but are affordable such that if he gets a hold in them or bleach on them  they can be replaced      
488,5.0,                       i m a woman and like to wear mens tshirts to hang in house and sleep in  i get them nice and big  these t shirts  are very comfy  and i like the colors     
489,4.0,                       i buy these for shorter than normal sleeve length so that my short sleeve outer shirts don t show the tee shirt sleeves  this time the shirt sleeves were longer than i ve had in the past      
490,2.0,                       these shirts feel like all the worst parts of cheap wool and cardboard turned inside out the fit   to be gentle   is nothing short of horrendous  i m not exactly sure what body type they re targeting    but it s definitely not for beer drinking barely qualifying as fit middle aged adult cis males  i hate leaving bad reviews  but i just can t personally find anything redeeming about these shirts  your mileage may vary  but they re just not for me      
491,5.0,                       for my husband perfectly  will order a different color combo next time  a must have staple in your closet and at a very reasonable  price      
492,5.0,                       online the quality and the comfort of the law t shirts  but they are   or   inches too short  i wish they made them longer  i like to tuck my t shirts in      
493,5.0,                       i started stealing my husband s undershirts to wear around the house during quarantine and finally decided to get some of my own  these are very soft but durable material  much nicer feeling than hanes or fruit of the loom  these aren t as thick as kirkland undershirts  which is good because those are too heavy for me these do fit much more snugly than other brands  the xl in these is about the same as the l in hanes and fruit of the loom when laid out on top of each other i washed and dried one of the black ones on cold water wash low heat in the dryer and it did not shrink when compared to the other black one in the package  i like my t shirts a little looser and have big boobs so the xl in these is very comfortable      
494,4.0,                       t shirts fit my husband fine until they were washed and then they shrunk in the length  does anyone make a t shirt that is long  these t shirt s fit good every where else  except they are slightly short in the length  the material is nice and somewhat soft  if they could make the shirts a little longer they would be perfect  i think other reviewers mentioned dirty spots on the shirts  i also had that problem  the top shirt in my pack was dirty when it arrived  but i washed it and it came out fine      
495,5.0,                       love these shirts  they fit perfectly   the fabric is a medium of weight  overall i m very glad i bought these      
496,3.0,                       i would have given this   stars because ive bought gilden clothing my whole life  but these were not soft  they re kind of itchy and super thin  plus the sizes are not what the size chart in the images shows   i have itn  stars because i think this was a quality issue with these particular ones that slipped through qa s hands   because  every gildan tshirt  hoodie  jacket and all the other products i ve bought throughout my who life have been amazing quality at rock bottom prices   this is why almost every custom shirt and hoodie design print shop use this brand   whosalers can get them for less than a dollar  and we get them for    to    usually but we dont have to set up and manage a tax id system to become a wholesaler  most branded plain tshirts cost     up to      at some stores and you get the same product with gildan for    to      both expensive brands and gilden use cotton or different blends if you prefer to buy them and are both tshirts   a tshirt is a tshirt made of the fabric you choose  the only difference is name   i also recommend amazon basics clothing  it s high fashion  perfect fit and low cost      
497,5.0,                       these t shirts fit great  they re soft and just stretchy enough  the longer than average length is a very nice extra  the price is soooooo much better than king sized    for the price of    that it is almost painful  no sewn in tag to stick out or cut into my neck either  the only negative is that i didn t search enough for v neck t shirts with a pocket   my bad  i would most definitely recommend these t shirts      
498,4.0,                       i ve had several brands of v neck shirts to wear with open collared button up shirts  but i cannot wear these gildans that way   the bottom of the v cut is too high  and the t shirt is exposed   i would not have been permitted to wear these shirts when i was wearing uniforms with strict dress codes   if the collar s button is used  the shirts won t be exposed  but in that case  a normal non v neck shirt would be ok   they appear to be durable  but i can t rate longevity yet      
499,5.0,                       shirt length is important to me  as i prefer that my t shirts stay tucked in throught the day  and are long enough to cover the waistline and tops of my front and back pants pockets if i wear them untucked  this shirt is perfect for both these shirts are thick enough to stay wrinkle  resistant and not bunch up in areas of movement beneath an outer layer like a button up or sweatshirt as outerwear wear  i can wear a black a shirt tucked in underneath it without the a shirt printing through the weave of the v neck these shirts are exceptional  will be ordering more soon in order to stay stocked up      
500,5.0,                       nothing to dislike  fit great and are soft  my husbands loves them     
501,2.0,                       shirts are fine  fit as intended  nice quality   however the heading clearly says    pack    the picture clearly shows   shirts     black    white     charcoal    the package i received was only   pack    the  rd black shirt was missing    the ad is misleading  the heading says one thing    shirts  and looking back now at the description   under the sizing chart  it only has   shirts listed    color     black     white     charcoal        
502,1.0,                       poor quality  felt cheap and thinner than i would have expected  free delivery was fine but it would have been actually cheaper to go to walmart  they all ended up performing barely adequately as cleaning rags for my cari recommend do not purchase     
503,3.0,                       the fitment is actually ok  the v neck is a little large and the quality feels meh   when compared to some t shirts i bought from walmart  george  the gildan feels cheaper and they don t hold the color as well      
504,2.0,                       i m          and it s hard to find shirts for me since i don t have a belly and i m so tall  so either a shirt is going to look like a parachute on me or a belly shirt  this one was very very much a parachute  returned because it was just so wide     
505,3.0,                       sleeves arms too big   before washing and drying they were huge  but now it shrunk considerably  i m a medium     pds  ordered medium was to small  exchanged for large was too big  now we have washed a bit tight  it feels like a tight medium  but after a while they do expand  have learned to stretch them prior of use  not a great material but it will do for the price  they do shrink a lot        
506,1.0,                       i bought these because i love the gilda brand  but these shrank really bad the first time i washed them so the fit got weird and the bottom hem on a few of them started unraveling   they are pretty soft though      
507,4.0,                       these are pretty good for the price  they fit as expected and very soft and comfortable  i use them as undershirt and they are great  you can wear them casually for summer as well  but remember they are not very thick  for the price these are great      
508,5.0,                       i am a chef and i go througha lot of black tshirts i like these because they re not too thick and doesn t absorb heat it also doesn t hold sauce stains easy to just wipe of with a towel and water  it is a money saver and i do recommend to anyone that work in heated conditions      
509,4.0,                       the best shirts are probably at the     oz cotton but this one isnt horrible     oz cotton is the worst  this one will probably hold up through    or so washes  so that equates to enough value for me   gotta keep it reasonable      
510,5.0,                       so i normally wear a small or medium  i bought these as a size small  even though they say small is        and i have a     chest  but i got them to be undershirts  and they work great for that  it s maybe    a little tight at the armpit but so far i like it a lot  it s a little lower v than i normal like  but again  it s an undershirt  and you often can only barely see it under my button up shirts i ve washed and dried these on cool  and lost a little length but not much width  so  i m a fan  the sleeves are short enough that i don t have to roll them up ever under my shirts  i often have to roll up sleeves with my other white shirts  so they don t stick out under the sleeves      
511,4.0,                       these are nice shirts at a great value   i would only recommend that they be worn as a true undershirt  as the thickness and finish don t really make them suitable for outerwear  in my opinion   they make wonderful undershirts  however  and i am happy with this purchase   i wear a xxl and i find that that the v neck is a bit higher than on other  similar shirts  and as such can display slightly through an open collared shirt   if that s a big deal for you  i d recommend a jockey t shirt or something else with a bit deeper of a v      
512,2.0,                       these were not as baggy as i hoped or as soft as i hoped  the price was right and i guess they will do  but i might have been better off at walmart next time      
513,5.0,                       i bought these shirts as nite shirts  large  normally i d wear a medium if i wanted it to fit right      
514,5.0,                       good product  good fit  good price but most importantly  great cotton content   hard to find these days        
515,5.0,                       best v neck you can buy and the price is great      better than my military issue         
516,2.0,                       nope  won t buy these again  looked good upon arrival but became disaster after laundering  they wrinkle horribly  who wants to iron a t shirt  they also act as a lint magnet  nope  just wear them for yard work  working in the garage  or whatever floats your boat      
517,3.0,                       have always bought this brand and wear them as sleep shirts   they are very thin and shrink up quite a bit   hence buying a large instead of a medium    hope they last a bit longer than the last ones i bought locally       
518,5.0,                       grabbed size bigger as most shrink down a size  these are true to size and doesn t shrink  wash well and keep color      
519,4.0,                       the shirts fit well even after washing  they fit a bit snug  it is not the softest material  it works as a general undershirt      
520,5.0,                       these were perfect shirts for work  i am a drummer for wedding bands and i bought these shirts to wear under my dress cloths  they fit comfortably under my dress shirt and absorb my sweat like i need it too  this is a quality cotton shirt for a great price      
521,5.0,                       i love these tees   they don t shrink   they fit perfect   i love the v neck  the length  the colors  etc   it s comfort for a very good price      
522,3.0,                       i feel a little silly complaining about shirts that cost around    each  but here s what i don t like       the length shrank significantly after washing drying  making it impossible to tuck in when worn as an under shirt  and making it look ridiculously short as a standalone t shirt       the sleeves are  really  short  shorter than they appear in the product picture  with a too large opening      the material is coarse and scratchy   it softens up a bit after multiple washings  but it doesn t exactly feel nice against the skin       i ve never had a t shirt come out of the dryer as wrinkly as these doon the bright side         the shirts seem reasonably well made         per shirt is stupid cheap     
523,3.0,                       these shirts are ok  except for a few issues  they are heavier than i like  even though they specify lightweight  they don t feel soft to to touch  but feel ok  when worn  also the v neck isn t big enough  and still tightens around neck some  these shirts are long  causing me to sit on tail  which is causing the neck line to ride up  this is fine as i like a long shirt tail  i just pull it up some when sitting  alleviating the tightness around neck  again  ok shirts for only    a piece      
524,3.0,                       the v neck opening is much larger than other brands i have   it looks closer to a women s shirt as far as the neckline is concerned  makes me think i just stepped out of the   s     
525,5.0,                       i bought a pack of crew neck first and loved the fit so i went for a pack of vs for under dress shirts and these are equally good  very comfortable  good fit through shoulders  chest  and waist with good length for tucking in  i m a med slight build and while the larges are slightly large out of the pack  a few high heat dryer cycles have given a slight shrink that works perfectly for me      
526,1.0,                       the shirts are cheaply made  they are super thin and fit horrible  i tried to was them and they shrunk in half  worst waist of money  do not buy          
527,4.0,                       they re not quite as comfortable as my calvin klein t shirts  but they cost     as much  i love that i was able to get a shirt for every day of the week without breaking the bank  i would give them five stars  but some are smaller than others  the qc for uniformity is lacking  that said  they re close enough in size that i don t really mind  they all still fit  just some are a little bit shorter  by maybe     an inch      
528,5.0,                       very true to size and has nice material  got them for my boyfriend because he needed more and he loved them      
529,5.0,                       purchased  for my son last year and again this year because they are true to size  soft and held up through endless washes and didn t  shrink in the dryer great price for the package      
530,2.0,                       based on the description i was hoping these were a better fit and wicked more  after the first wash they have lost their shape  this is a bad buy      
531,5.0,                       the most comfortable t shirt i ve ever worn  fits perfectly after wash  the material is cool outside in sunlight but warm at night  i figure this is akin to what royals  celebrities and billionaires wear      
532,1.0,                       just wanted to state that inside the package was one item that was not a v neck and was branded  george   the package was sealed so it must be an error in manufacturing  besides  the t shirts were way to big  strangely  the george one  fitted nicely and it was xl too  seems i will have to buy from this brand the next time      
533,1.0,                       sizes fit as ordered   but these are extremely low quality shirts  brand new shirt on first wear had holes within a few minutes from poor stitching  a second shirt had stitching falling out right from the pack    of   shirts ended up needing to be thrown out after first wear  hanes  fruit of the loom  even the costco brand t shirts are vastly better  these have terrible stitching and the company must have very subpar quality control  avoid     
534,5.0,                       they are not slim fit  thanks goodness  some may feel they are a little big but i love them and wear them almost every day color is looooong lasting  real quality cotton     
535,5.0,                       some of the best v necks out there and for the price you cant go wrong  perfect for the gym or around the house  even a casual day out  fits slim and true to the body  not too tight on body  torso   but just right on the shoulder and chest area  also machine washed  x so far under hot water and dried under high temp  and no shrinkage or loss of form  seems to be durable and thick cotton material  highly recommended      
536,4.0,                       it s a pack of v neck shirts  no complaints there  quality seems on par  ordered xl based on past experience with similar shirts  but they were too large  i washed them just to see if they would shrink  but no cigar  i will keep them to wear for work or getting dirty  but i wish sizes could be a little more uniform between companies who make essentially the same product      
537,4.0,                       keep in mind that this t shirt is good only as underwear  you feel free wearing it  they are not too tight the stitches are not really straight it s convenient to wear this t shirt under a shirt or sweater since it has a v neck and it doesn t poke out of your outerwear  it s long enough the best thing about this t shirt is that it s     cotton so you don t feel any discomfort wearing it and your skin doesn t get irritated i don t recommend drying it in a dryer as it can get shrunken  it s better to hang it while it s still a bit wet and let it dry this way      
538,1.0,                       was super bummed when we found a hole in one of the shirts    i read that other reviewers had this problem but i was hoping we wouldn t           
539,4.0,                       i just lost    lbs and had to  downgrade  my wardrobe from a  x to a l  they are a little thin  but overall good  when they wear out or i inevitably drip paint on them or something  i would definitely buy again  good deal for the price      
540,4.0,                       since retiring i live in t shirts  it s not easy finding the type i like  i love them big  soft and long  these work great for the money      
541,2.0,                       cheap product  not soft on skin  it was made from very poor product      
542,1.0,                       medium is a tiny bit big  but not bad issue  super thin and see through  probably great as a hidden undershirt  not great as an outfit nips for days      and    lbs     
543,5.0,                       i purchased this for my crew  nice quality and good for my work     
544,5.0,                       i bought these for my    yr old husband to wear under his dress shirts for church  they are good looking and comfortable      
545,3.0,                            athletic build  bought medium because that s what i normally wear  sleeves barely go past the shoulder and then loosen up and flare out after about    minutes of moving around  material isn t bad but the fit isn t great  probably just use it as a house shirt just to throw on  i order the amazon essentials slim fit v neck shirts in the same size at the same time i ordered these and they fit way better  they are the same price but only   shirts so you get what you pay for i guess      
546,1.0,                       when i received these the idea was to do the dye  but some of the shirts had hole  and one had a sleeve that was half torn off      
547,5.0,                       i liked that it is very white in color and fit my husband just right  he said it is soft and comfortable and wears them around the house all the time      
548,5.0,                       this package worked great  i bought on package  it had     shirts which i devided up and gave one tshirt with one of the pair of pj pants and everyone loved their pj set      
549,3.0,                       i am      and     lbs   previously i had fruit of the loom  small   undershirts that were slightly loose after washed   i purchased these to replace them  but they shrunk too much   i don t mind the body being a little tight but they are too tight in the arm pits   i will probably donate them and go back to what i know      
550,5.0,                       love the fit  and shirts are tag less  which adds to comfort  length did not shrink after washing which is great      
551,5.0,                       these are good quality and comfortable   the price is right for these nice shirts  if i were to change anything it would be a more tapered and form fitting but still loose enough to not be to tight  i am happy     
552,5.0,                       arrived as expected  colors as shown  shirts are      cotton  so i expect them to shrink considerably  if i remember  i ll update this review to let you know how much shrinkage i see      
553,5.0,                       i was impressed with how soft and comfortble the fabric is  but the v neck is too large  it gives the shirt a very sloppy look  as a result i am very disappointed  i will not buy again      
554,5.0,                       bought this to try as i ve lost weight and going from  x to  x   been using haynes forever   this shirt is great   fits large  is about same fit as the haynes  x   nice soft fabric   neck seems to be keeping its shape   definitely a great value and will buy again      
555,5.0,                       i needed v neck shirts for the upcoming warm weather  amazon had the color scheme of shirts i grew fond of  so i decided to purchase this reasonable deal  the garments are meet my standards  i am satisfied with my purchase      
556,5.0,                       exactly what i thought it would be   v neck shirts that look and feel great  and are the best brand i have bought so far  v neck shirts in color are a nice change of pace from the normal white ones you find in stores      
557,4.0,                       boxy   fine to wear just around the house to lounge in  good enough for the price of having   for about          
558,4.0,                       for me these shirts ran not only big but extra big  i weigh    lbs and im only  ft   and the large was the equivalent to an xxl for me  the shirts themselves were great no issues they have the tag printed on instead of a tag sewn on which is amazing  and for the price you cannot beat em  if i was to order these again i would get a medium or even try the small  i am using these as work shirts so it isnt really a big deal that they are big because i am expecting them to get dirty fast      
559,2.0,                       i m happy with how quickly these were delivered    however  this is what we got when we opened the package  big black smudge on the top shirt  haven t even checked the other ones out yet  definitely not happy about it      
560,5.0,                       my husband loved them  perfect fit  hes          lbs  it s not tight around his broad shoulders or too loose around his more narrow waist  it hangs pass his belt so it s great for stretching and bending  they feel soft and i d recommend them      
561,4.0,                       fits perfect n great price  haven t washed them yet though      
562,5.0,                       fit true too size   soft and comfortable tshirts great for work shirts   colors r very nice  and price is great      
563,2.0,                       disappointed   washed  cool but not cold water  and machine dried  medium settings  them just once and they shrunk at least     and looked wrinkly as heck      
564,2.0,                       at first i was very happy with these v neck shirts that i was going to wear under my work shirt  after a couple of washes in luke warm or cold water  i noticed they had shrunk a little  when i tried on of the black ones on the other day  it felt tight and had shrunk even more  i have a long back and normally wear tall xl if i can get it but since i needed some undershirts quickly  i went with these ones  i guess you get what you pay for  i will pass them along to my local charity shop and go get some better pre shrunk under shirts over the holidays      
565,2.0,                       purchased a pack of the  v  necks and a pack of regular neck for my husband  they are cut small and the  v  necks are large and stretched out looking around the neck  the only reason i m not returning them is because they are cheap enough i can just use them for dust rags      
566,5.0,                       despite the mixed reviews on this product about product quality and questionable fit  i went ahead and made the purchase because i really wanted black v neck undershirts  and these were the highest rated shirts available my experience so far  size l shirts  is that the fit is appropriate  the fabric is not  thick  like a normal t shirt  but is thinner as you would expect for an undershirt  and the length is good for the shirt stayed tucked in your pants and not get pulled out during the course of the day i will come back and update this review if something negative happens with the shirts      
567,4.0,                       looked fine   i am probably a largish medium   i use these white t shirts for underwear   the t shirts that i buy for outerwear are usually large and i m quite comfortable with that size   but here large seemed slightly too large   still ok though   i m pleased   but next time  if these are still available  i ll choose medium size      
568,3.0,                       i m female and ordered them to use a pajama shirts  usually a men s small fits nice and baggy on me but this shirt fits like a women s small  definitely size up i would recommend      
569,2.0,                       i ve worn each of these     times now  and two of them already have fallen apart with holes under the armpits  also  as others have mentioned  these shrunk a ton  and while the fit is fine elsewhere  the length of them is now comically short  i can really only wear them around the house  they are not very soft  and overall just poor shirts  even though these are quite cheap  i d suggest spending your money elsewhere      
570,5.0,                       i got these for my work  and they fit quite well out of the box  they re      cotton  so it s probably helpful to block dry them the first time you wash them to avoid shrinkage  they seem to be durable  but they re light enough to wear during the summer in texas while working in a warehouse  i was a little disappointed that the five of them were one light gray  one dark gray  and three black  would have liked to have more of the lighter colors  but that s my only complaint  well worth the money      
571,3.0,                       first off  quality of material is great for what was        per shirt when i purchased them  the size however runs very large   i am normally an x large so that is what i went with  these shirts are more like a xxl  for my     wife they go below her knees   this is just my experience  hopefully yours is different   if you happen to need t shirt fabric these are outstanding as a crafts store would charge at least twice as much per yard      
572,1.0,                       worked perfectly out of the packaging but after the first wash    whoa   turned into a belly shirt and the sleeve shrank too throwaway now as i bought these to be able to tuck them in and stay tucked  that s not happening        
573,5.0,                       you can t go wrong with this buy   the fit it s just right   well made   no flaws  at a great price no more going to walmart and paying more for tee shirts      
574,5.0,                       fits per size chart  minimal shrinking in warm wash   very comfortable and durable   would buy again      
575,5.0,                       i believe they are a little heavier than the fruit of the loom s that i had purchased locally  i cannot speak to durability yet but they won t have to be too durable to out last the fotl s  good price for a good shirt  made in honduras      
576,4.0,                       always my favorite brand of t shirts  great quality and fit and great price      
577,5.0,                       bought these for work  working outside was looking for something that not only fit great but feels great and not too hot  great find    this is just what i was looking for  love the v neck too       
578,5.0,                       it s your basic black tee  it fits well and works under shirts or just as a regular black tee  we ve put it through a few washes  cold  and it has not faded much nor has it shrunk  but then again  i use a ventless dryer  evaporative drying  so i no longer have issues with shrinking clothes  seems to be holding up well for some fairly inexpensive t shirts      
579,5.0,                       the quality and fit of these t shirts is very good  i typically wear a large t shirt and purchased these shirts in a size large   i wear my dress shirts with the top button undone  and the v neck of these t shirts drops just below the second button so its not visible  these t shirts are very white and material is a good weight thickness   these t shirts are much better than i expected  especially after reading some of the other reviews   at a cost of less than    per shirt  i have zero complaints      
580,3.0,                       the tshirts are short  i ordered large  and fits good  loose  but short  if i upper my arms my belly shows  well  for the price i selected them to wear them as job clith so they work good     
581,5.0,                       love these tees  wanted something soft for lounging sleeping and these are perfect  light enough to keep from sweating but not too thin  definitely not see through  like the v neck  glad they are tagless against my sensitive skin   have a hard time finding clothes soft enough to wear since my illness  i like them baggy so these are size  x mens for me  a           pound woman  like that they are not so long as other brands i have  they cover but not like a dress  sleeves also are not hanging down to my elbows but long enough to cover my upper arms  they look nice enough to wear out so i do sometimes wear them to the store  but mostly enjoy them around the house      
582,3.0,                       these shirts are at least a size larger than hanes xl s   they do have a chest size on the neck label         but i didn t know that when i ordered them  they are huge by comparison   they are soft enough  but the stitching isn t very tidy   in   or   places inside each shirt  there were pairs of unsecured loose threads dangling  about           inches long   i tied them off so they wouldn t unravel while swishing around in the washing machine on the plus side  the seams are covered across the shoulders  and the back of the neck   also  seams in the sides of the shirts check the numeric size before you buy          etc    the size number and size category  large  etc   may not be in sync with other brands you buy      
583,5.0,                       i had purchased these a couple of years ago at a store  didn t think i would find them again  there they were  these are the best under shirts  try them you won t be sorry      
584,3.0,                       they re regular v neck tees  fabric wasn t soft enough  and the fit was a little too loose i bought a large   if the fit was better i d have been more likely to keep them   i have tees that are very similar to these but i was looking for something a little different      
585,5.0,                       soft comfy did not shrink when washed not even afyer the   th wash still perfect color softness an size i do use downy an their baby soft     
586,5.0,                       the fit was perfect  nice shirts  i ll order more later      
587,2.0,                       i looked for v neck tee shirts with a pocket and found these in the listing  problem  no pocket  why did this come up  very disappointed with this and amazon  stop mixing things in with my request      
588,5.0,                       i buy this for my husband and he love it  he is      and     lbs and the size xl fit him perfect  the material is soft and price is great for the quality of this shirts      
589,5.0,                       i bought these for myself to wear to bed  i ordered a size large and my chest size is    inches  they fit perfectly   fall just below my hip bone  i was surprised the quality is good  i could even wear these shirts out      
590,1.0,                       i liked these shirts because they are cheap and look nice but omg i wear one of these shirts under my hoodie and lint was stuck on it  look at the picture   the washer and dryer just made it worst  would not recommend drying with other shirts or clothes  this shirt is a lint trap     
591,5.0,                       very comfortable  and soft  great fit  have not had any shrinking issues  great value      
592,1.0,                       when i got these new last week they are perfect out of the package  after the first wash   cold water gentile cycle in washer and dryer with darks detergent  the shirts shrunk and lost form  now they fit sloppy and shrunk in odd ways mainly to short for the money these are a great value buy you get what you pay for      
593,5.0,                       i buy a pack of these at the start of every spring  i have broad shoulders and a big neck  other brands  hanes  are too tight on my neck  yes  even v necks  and are uncomfortable  if you have a big neck  and or chest and shoulders   i highly recommend the deep v neck and comfort of these over any brand  and i ve owned them all  gildan makes a quality shirt and at        for six   it s an easy choice      
594,5.0,                       the tshirts are okay  i got what i paid for  would i buy more  yes  they are good for daily use     
595,5.0,                       love these shirts   i live in fruit of the loom men s white v necks  size large    ordered these to give me colors and i must say they are better quality and run just a tad bigger and longer then fruit of the loom which is great for me   will buy more in different colors     
596,1.0,                       no goodi after your wash it the neck is cut to large   i brough small and they are still to big     
597,5.0,                       husband is well satisfied   he says they are very soft and comfortable      
598,3.0,                       normally when i buy undershirts in this size they fit and i decide to try this brand but it was too large now i cant wear them as undershirt  they should have been ordered two sizes smaller     
599,4.0,                       they are worth a little less than the price  awkward fit  cut  rough fabric   worse after first wash might use them twice then repurpose as a rag  better to buy for clothing drives or emergency undershirt     
600,2.0,                       i bought these to sleep in instead of stealing my husbands soft shirts  these are a stiff and not very soft and if you get the v neck the point of the v has extra material that rubs on your skin irritating it so i hardly wear them      
601,5.0,                       i bought them for my son  they fit as expected and he asked for more  he doesn t want light colors  i wish i had other color choices in packaging      
602,4.0,                       received my   pack as pictured first wash of the darker grey  shrunk    from the bottom     on each side  and    on sleeves minimal shrinkage   still roomy and large     
603,4.0,                       this is the first time buying this brand and they don t fit  they are a size to small  the tag says large but they fit like a medium   other than that they are soft and well constructed     
604,2.0,                       i bought a pack of these in  small   because i wear medium size shirts  even after shrinking in the wash  these shirts are still much larger than a  small  should be  they re also not long enough to stay tucked  this leads to a surprisingly uncomfortable situation where my outer shirt has stayed tucked into my pants  but my loose undershirt has pulled loose and is bunched up at the small of my back i would consider these to be acceptable outerwear  normal t shirts   except that they re v necks  so they re completely useless to me good quality though      
605,5.0,                       v neck is a nice option for a solid color tee      
606,4.0,                       i purchased these shirts for work and they fit just right  they do shrink in the wash the first time you wash them but after that they are good  highly recommend if you need short sleeve black shirts      
607,5.0,                       wasn t sure if they were going to be thin enough but they were   i dislike heavy cotton t shirts   would buy again      
608,3.0,                       it s a simple t shirt  no frills  the material is on the stiffer side  and it s not as soft as some more expensive t shirts i have  if you do something where you get your clothes dirty a lot like construction i feel like this would be perfect  but if you re looking for softness and comfort  i might spend a little more somewhere else      
609,5.0,                       i use gildan shirts whenever i can   these shirts fit great and are even better than the far more expensive fotl and hanes shirts that end up shrinking too much  if you are bigger chested then these are the shirts you want      
610,5.0,                       not a       sizing   i normally wear roundtree and yorke  t s   they are a perfect fit out of the package and don t shrink  i have other gildan shirts and they fit just fine   don t know why then the white t s   a good buy but the will have to be returned      
611,3.0,                       just opened up the package and the top shirt was dirty at the v neck center  it looks like the inspector didn t do his or her job on a clean surface when they obviously taped all   shirts together  not happy about this because the return window is past already      
612,5.0,                       these shirts were a great buy  i needed more basics in my closet and since they don t make shirt packs for women for some reason i went with men s  i got an xl since that s what i usually get in women s and i wanted it to be a little bigger  it fits exactly as i wanted and expected  it s lightweight and soft      
613,5.0,                       they are not too thin and not too thick  can be used comfortably as an undershirt  but thick enough to wear on its own  i have a long torso and these gildan tees are longer than other tees so they work great      
614,5.0,                       i bought it for my husband and he liked them  very comfortable and fits his body shape nicely nice to have more then one color in pack of five  very economical  will buy again for sure      
615,5.0,                       these shirts a great  very soft and true to size  i m impressed with how comfortable they are     
616,4.0,                       almost good   i m honestly wasn t expecting anything at all i was sure i ll return it just like i did with other tshirts i returned  to my surprise the quality is good and price is awesome  only thing i don t like is the size of the neck  it s too wide   i don t wear v neck to be honest   i bought this just to try and wasn t expecting anything  i ll be sure buying this brand again in different neck style     
617,5.0,                       bought them for my husband for the second time fits great he likes them  they wash very well      
618,5.0,                       these were a gift for my husband and he really likes them  he says that they fit just right and are very comfortable  by the way  he s the one that came up with the headline      
619,5.0,                       it s a great shirt not tight at all   a very traditional tshirt fit      
620,5.0,                       the best shirt so far  it fits nicely and it won t get deformed when washed  which is the most important to me  i just wish they would stay bright white  even with the best detergent they would turn kind of off white      
621,5.0,                       i got these shirts as night shirts for myself  very comfy  fit well  my husband stole   of them and wear them often  nice shirts  clean up well      
622,2.0,                       they shrink in such an unflattering and weird way after i washed them  i really dislike the fit      
623,5.0,                       they don t fade they don t wrinkle there s softand very comfortable     
624,3.0,                       i loved the first pack of shirts great deal fit perfect  so i decide to re order second pack comes it s a   pack when the order clearly states   pack  i go through steps to have second order replaced and it comes also   pack so im in process of figuring out what to do  help amazon please tell me what to do     
625,4.0,                       i have pretty much always bought hanes  but decided to try something else   so far  i am quite happy with these   they seem a bit thinner  but they fit better  including the longer length  staying tucked in better when you want it   the v neck is higher   tighter than hanes   will be interesting to see how they wear over time  but so far  so good      
626,5.0,                       product fits well  colors lovely  little wrinkly out of the dryer but i take them put before actually dried  a little bit of spandex material might have helped that will buy again n again thank you     
627,5.0,                       perfect fit for me and i love the value i probably bought eight packs  and will continue to buy them perfect size perfect weight and very durable  the fit for me is perfect cuz i have big boobs and i m a woman and a plus size      
628,3.0,                       i bought   packs of six and i ve already had a few where the stitching has come loose so don t expect high quality construction  but they are soft and well fitting  i use them as just a generic shirt to throw on while doing housework or cooking  the v neck makes it well ventilated in a hot kitchen and since they re black i don t have to worry about stains      
629,1.0,                       sold as   pack  picture shows   shirts  package arrived and it was   shirts      
630,5.0,                       i was looking for a t shirt for my husband to wear underneath a gangster suit jacket for halloween   not only perfect for the suit  but he has worn one other during the day  and another as a nightshirt   multiple uses for these t shirt  great fit  not too tight  and soft cotton       
631,5.0,                       i ve been using these for a while now and really love them as undershirts   they re very comfortable to sleep in and do a great job protecting my real shirts that i wear over top from deodorant buildup and discoloration      
632,5.0,                       i recently purchased these undershirts for my husband  they fit as expected  are a nice clean white  and seem to be a good quality      
633,3.0,                       overall  i think the shirts are a good deal and decent value for the price  unfortunately  one of the shirts arrived with a couple holes under the arm  i purchased these shirts for my partner as a gift  and inspecting each shirt for holes was not my first instinct when he opened them he already wore one of the shirts  so i don t know if it s eligible for a return  the price is still reasonable for four shirts  but i have yet to look over the others  i ll update the review if i find more  not sure if one shirt is worth an entire refund  but kind of disappointed they didn t all arrive in good condition  without the holes  i would have rated   stars      
634,3.0,                       these shirts are nice its just these aren t washer machine friendly because these shirts fade so fast on the first wash its unbelievable and the shrink is very real     
635,5.0,                       took a shot on these in both crew neck and v neck cuts in hopes of saving money over hanes comfortsoft tees  glad i did this as they re just as good as hanes for a much lower price  as long as this brand stays reasonably priced and well made  these t shirts will be my new daily drivers      
636,3.0,                       t shirt has  very thin materialshort sleeves could have been longercomfortable to wear but not under a shirt sleeves roll up     
637,5.0,                       good material will buy again posted          w randolph     
638,5.0,                       i m a fat old lady that uses these tee shirts to sleep in  i m         pounds and apple shaped  i ordered the xl  which after shrinking about    all over in the wash  fit loose and very comfortable  these shirts have a good overall length and ample arm room and length as well  the shirts are very soft and stretchy and the vee neck is a proper depth  gildan please make these in more colors  i ve bought two sets already and they ve held up great after several washes  if you re in the middle of two sizes  order a size up because these shirts shrink quite a bit  the terrific price makes them a winner  i love these shirts        
639,5.0,                       i feel like the quality of these shirts and how it fits on me is better than fruit of loom and hanes  of course it won t be better than brand names like calvin klein and tommy hilfiger but for around     for   quality t shirts  you can t really beat this price  i m definitely going to purchase more once the t shirts starts fading shrinking      
640,5.0,                       i like the gildan products i have used  they fit well  wear well  wash well  better than ftl or hanes and many other brands  these are better made      
641,5.0,                       i got medium but it fitted a bit loosely exchanged for a small  no hassle quick and easy  small did fit how i wanted it   not too tight but not too loose  shirt fabric feels comfortable  would recommend     
642,3.0,                       not really that good of quality and the fitment wasn t all that great either  i would rather buy at the store next time  they fade right away and the wrinkle badly not what i expected      
643,4.0,                       i like these  even though they aren t made of thick cotton  they are comfortable as well i got the x large  which fit me just fine  as i am of a rather  stocky  build  even though i m not very tall the color does not run when these are washed  and they don t seem to shrink either  nice shirts      
644,4.0,                       very roomy sizing and comfortably soft material  fit is fine but length runs a bit long      
645,5.0,                       nice medium weight shirt  so not see through which is good  cause most cheap tshirts you can see through  this is a well made product  my son loves it and he has nf  which causes tumor growth on nerve endings and this is the first plain t shirt he didn t have a problem with         
646,3.0,                       i like the way the shirts feel and look   they feel like quality shirts i would give them   stars all day long   there s a major problem that just has me shaking my head   do not clip a pen to the collar when you go shopping     the result  tears holes in the fabric   i ve never had any shirts that were so easily damaged   it took me a while to figure out why there were holes in one specific location for the record  i ve used the same pen with other shirts without having problems   there s no jagged edge just the pressure of the pen s clasp and dragging from attaching detaching      
647,5.0,                       i really love it  it is not only a great price   it is a very good item      
648,5.0,                       good set of t shirts  do not shrink in the laundry  nice v neck  thick enough to wear as a shirt or undershirt  comfortable and soft to the touch  reasonably priced v neck  non itchy and came quick  will purchase again      
649,2.0,                       great shirts  if you like rips   too bad because they fit well and look good  now i have to go through the hassle of a return or just throw it on the ever growing pile of  things i bought that didn t work out and couldn t be bothered anymore    the good news is i discovered i can have two shirtless sleeves and have one sleeveless shirt left over   of course if i got some replacements without any hassle i d be more inclined to change my review of my holy shirts      
650,5.0,                       these were the right undershirts for the right price  my first time using the brand  gildan  and i was very happy  there was little to no shrinkage after washing and putting in the dryer  they are a nice bright white  i am pleased and may look into buying these in various colors      
651,2.0,                       i opened the package to find   shirts that were defective  specifically one of them had a sticker indicating that it probably didn t pass inspection  the bottom of that shirt sleeve was sewn to the seem at the shoulder and separating the two caused a hole  the shirts are      cotton so they will shrink but other than that they re okay shirts      
652,3.0,                       received these t shirts  and checked to make sure its      cotton as stated  washed and put softener to ensure i get the most comfort but noticed the t shirt seems  not as soft as most cotton t shirts  bought a second set from a different brand  and did the exact same thing  and the t shirt was soft and comfortable  i may be critical  but i wear t shirts all the time  so i m not being picky  rather i m basing my opinion on the comfort level  this was not up to par  and i m wondering whether the cotton used for this t shirt doesn t have the softness factor      
653,5.0,                       i am a         lb female that refuses to pay the ridiculous price for women s  nightgowns    ordered these bad boys in an xl and they do the trick  super comfy   worth the price      
654,5.0,                       there is nothing better than comfortable t shirt  arrived with no funny smells  the material is soft but not super soft  all seems are put together well  would buy this again      
655,5.0,                       fit is great and it s very comfy  definitely wirth the price  don t wait for it        
656,5.0,                       i like the quality of the shirts and the durability long term      
657,3.0,                       short sleeve length makes a man look like a little boy overgrown wearing close too short for the general physique  the dimensions on the sleeve are not proportionate with the garment overall a poor design dimensionally      
658,5.0,                       good quality for the money but some threading coming loose  i wear these shirts for manual labor jobs      
659,1.0,                       these t shirts are extremely unflattering to wear  they look like a tent that you d wrap yourself when it s raining  the cotton fabric is rough on the skin and not soft  these will make great cleaning rags  but i wouldn t wear them out in public      
660,5.0,                       we buy these tshirts at ross a lot and they hold up well  so i knew they would be ok  ordered the wrong size the first time  but my son likes them  he s     skinny and fits a medium pretty good  just wish shirts were a tad longer cuz he saggs his pants  other than that it fits ok  i ll start looking in big and tall clothing just for that reason  i need to find tall and skinny clothing  that s the ticket        
661,5.0,                       i told myself i needed to order more under shirts but couldnt decide on the brand  realized the t shirt for the band i saw the night before was gildan and fit perfectly  ordered these and then ended up ordering even more a week later     
662,3.0,                       shirt colors look great  fits me very well v neck is not too deep  the machine that seals the plastic left some plastic on one of the shirts see attached photo  hopefully it will come out in the wash or wear off      
663,5.0,                       these are great value for the money  it fits pretty good  and more importantly the body can breath  and it doesn t overheat  shows it is actually majority cotton      
664,2.0,                       remember  you get what you pay for  i haven t even wore the shirt yet and the seam is unraveling  i washed them and they came out that way  if you re looking for higher quality  spend a couple extra bucks      
665,2.0,                       gildan is usually a decent brand but one of the v neck shirts i was sent in a multipack was cut and sewn extremely off  the neck hole was so small i can only fit my hand through  the way the shirt is sewn around the neck line makes it lay really strangely on the body    i know it s only   in the multipack that is defective but gildan you need to improve your q a  dept      
666,5.0,                       i got them on sale for     they look and fit well  great value  i would buy them again if they weren t on sale      
667,5.0,                       i m a lady that got these to wear to gym with my leggings  i m      and     lbs and i got a men s m  it was just loose enough with a little fitting and style with vneck  they did shrink slightly although not much  next time i ll go with l to be both oversized and room for shrinkage  can t beat price  decent quality between thick and thin  minimal fading on black washed twice already     
668,5.0,                       update  after a couple washes  the color fades away  doesn t last as long when i first received the package  it was nicely packaged and when i tried on the t shirt it was very comfortable and fit accordingly to the size chart  i would      recommend this product      
669,5.0,                       absolutely great fit good thickness not too thick not too thin i love the shirts i ll definitely buy them again at some point the future     
670,5.0,                       perfect    best feeling shirt i ve felt in years  did not shrink when washed  held their shape great  just all around perfect       
671,5.0,                       fits very well even after a couple of washes     
672,5.0,                       good price nice fit and a good monochrome spectrum so i can wear my black or gray pants because i m boring     
673,3.0,                       hard to complain about a   pack of shirts that is so inexpensive  nice assortment  but one of the five shirts is very noticable uneven on the bottom  i wish quality control noticed the blatant mistake  for the price it still isn t a bad deal for four shirts      
674,3.0,                       the description and reviews suggest these t shirts may be worn as an outer  stand alone  t shirt  these are thin undershirts plain and simple  i washed them in cold water and air  no heat  dried them  they shrunk overall about         they shrunk     inches in length alone  the material thickness is very thin  nearly see thru  the neck does not hold its shape  they came out of being air dried needing to be ironed before wearing  if you re looking for a cheap undershirt and don t care if they are thin and come out of the dryer very wrinkled  this is the undershirt for you  at    for six shirts they are a good value for what they are  but i should have expected this type of lesser quality  very light weight  and thin material  if you decide to buy these undershirts  you should order at least a size larger than you normally wear      
675,2.0,                       not sure why there isnt a standard size for all clothing  these are for fat people to feel like they are fitting in smaller sizes  huge      
676,2.0,                       the shirts i received were      cotton  as stated on each shirt  instead of a blend  that defeats the entire purpose of why i bought these   there s a million other options for      cotton  these run a little big for a medium and could be a little longer  that said they ll work for under shirts so i guess i ll keep them      
677,5.0,                       met expectations in every respect   would buy again  except that i suspect i will have worn out before these t shirts       
678,4.0,                       ordered these for my son  he loves them  such a great value  arrived on time     
679,5.0,                       t shirts fit true and are very soft but also seem well made  the  v  isn t very deep which i like  in other reviews it mentioned the shirts were  ding  or the  packaging was not very good   i found neither of those situations with my purchase  however  there is a  window  on the front that allows you to feel the material that had a smudge but it washed right out  overall i m very satisfied with these gildan v neck t shirts      
680,5.0,                       this is my third pack of shirts that i ve received from this company and i m very very happy with how comfortable they are     
681,5.0,                       very pleased with the quality and feel of these shirts  much better than the ones i bought before from hanes or fl     
682,3.0,                       first  to be honest  i returned these items because they ran just to small for this big guy   my regular stafford t shirts are xl in size  so i ordered these in xxl hoping they would be a little loose or at least leave a little room for shrinkage   they were still way to tight all over   these fit more like a slim cut having said that  i really liked the material and the cut and the seams sewing   seemed to be reasonable quality for such a low price      
683,5.0,                       i am liking my gildan t shirts as they feel comfortable to my body and retains the shape without any notice of shrinkage   i expect to make another purchase of t shirts as soon as needed in the future      
684,5.0,                       this is my second time ordering these  the first time was black and gray  this second time is white  these gilden vees are my go to closet staple  slightly loose  long enough to knot and perfect for layering  they wash up great  are thin  i live in the south  and soft  good for vinyl application projects and tye dyed shirts as well  my info  female            lbs            i definitely will be ordering again      
685,5.0,                       i bought these for my fiance and he loves them  they  haven t shrunk yet after     washes   very soft  and the best part is they are not short like the others   no crop tops welcome   lol     
686,5.0,                       the whole point of a v neck t shirt is the  v   when the hem which makes that v is not wide enough  overtime  very little time  that v turns into in ugly u  that however it s not the case with these particular v neck t shirt  these will remain v necks for the life of the t shirt because of the  nice robot hem  additionaly the t shirts are slightly longer than normal  there is a very good reason for this  these t shirts are      cotton and as you wash cotton  it off and shrinks  most cotton t shirts will shrink vertically but not always horizontally  you end up with a wide  short shirt  again this is something that will not happen with these t shirts because someone actually put some thought into the design  and it is a very good design  i have to say  if you re looking for v necks these are the ones to buy      
687,5.0,                       the only thing i didn t like is how low cut the v was but that s not their problem  the shirt fits nice but buy it a size bigger bc it does shrink pretty drastically  i am     weighing     with semi muscular build  it looks good   great quality for the price      
688,4.0,                       good value but runs a little large but shrinks with the first wash  overall i am satisfied after i had to swap an xl for a large  after the first wash the size shrinks to about what you d expect for the sizing  it s comfortable  colors don t run  easy stay home shirt     
689,1.0,                       this is an awful shirt  the v is too wide compared to the body of the shirt so it sits very odd  after one wash it shrunk in a way that it twisted and all of them are unwearable   they also have this  fake  cotton feel that is awful to hold  it feels tacky for lack of a better term  almost like they used a cheap dye      
690,5.0,                       i love the v neck on these shirts  they fit well   and are well made  the black is a nice dark black      
691,1.0,                       i received the shirts and found   of them had no bottom hem sewn in at the bottom of the shirts  totally unusable and returned them promptly  you get what you pay for  buyer beware      
692,5.0,                       these shirts are so soft and comfortable      
693,2.0,                       shirts are comfortable enough and fit well  but the hem completely came out of one of them the second time it was washed  hopefully it was a fluke  but if it happens to another one i ll definitely update the review to say so      
694,2.0,                       i usually wear jockey t shirts  thought i would try a different brand  these are a major disappointment  after one wash  there are very boxy  too short and too wide and the v neck is too low return window is closed  maybe i will use them as rags      
695,4.0,                       great value  plenty roomy   as a fellow tith an    inch neck i really dislike crew necks  so it is nice to fond v necks that don t fit like a tent      
696,5.0,                       the quality has not changed over the years  minimal shrinkage after being washed  the shifts do have some thinkness and are not paper thin which makes them more comfortable to wear  the v neck in the front does come down low enough that the undershirt can be hidden underneath a scrub top with a v neck as well  great product      
697,5.0,                       im   foot  about     pounds  bit of a dad gut  large fit me good  average build   will look nicer if i lose a bit of the stomach but im not ashamed that it slightly noticeable     
698,4.0,                       all as advertised   i will throw my fruit of loom ones away as too short and don t stay tucked in   they are actually about   inches longer than hanes  which was   inches longer than fruit of loom   nice soft comfortable cotton   glad i ordered these rather than hanes   i ordered one of ther collar type   button front knit shirt this summer and  liked so tried this brand again   glad i did      
699,3.0,                       the fabric was very course but after several washes it has softened up     
700,5.0,                       there is honestly nothing better than coming out of a shower and stepping into these  i am   feet  s m  i get xxl or xl and they go down to my knees  genuinely nothong better      
701,5.0,                       at the price i expected these t shirts to be flimsy and only good for work in the yard   wrong  they are well made   fit good and look good enough to wear casually anywhere   excellent buy      
702,5.0,                       these v neck t shirts are perfect for men to wear under their regular shirts or alone around the house and yard      
703,1.0,                       fabric was too thick  coarse  stiff  it was a poor fit   hung like a burlap sack  poorly constructed   the armpit of   shirts was not sewn properly   they literally missed stitches leaving a hole in the armpit   they do not have the refined appearance of t shirts available everywhere  rather they look like surplus t shirts you d buy to do yard work or sell to a prison system  i don t know who sells tees that look like these  these days  i ll never buy another     
704,4.0,                       these shirts are not the greatest i ever owned but i purchase these shirts as lounge bed wear and for it s      cotton  not as outer under wear   so far i ve only worn   and haven t had a chance to see how it held up after washing drying      
705,2.0,                       fit a little strange  mens shirts normally are tailored to fit mostly larger around the shoulders to accommodate the male shape but these not so much  also for cotton they seemed pretty heavy  a wash didnt do much except for shrink them but it was already tight at the top so it made it worse      
706,5.0,                       nice basic t shirt for casual occasions or working out  would recommend      
707,1.0,                       based on your size chart i m suppose to be an xl  when i tried in the shirts  they re too big  i think your size chart is a little off  can u be so kind as to send me the correct size  i should be a large  thanks for ur understanding   help      
708,3.0,                       was significantly larger than other large sized shirts from other brands   looks too ridiculous on me with the huge v neck and tent like shirt   now i know i should have bought the medium size but i don t want to spend twice the money just for shirts that fit   maybe i ll use these as emergency rags   too bad      
709,2.0,                       fades out quick  they don t use a good black ink  so you have to replace quicker   scammer getting over on metarget on the other hand had this new brand for like           they come rolled up and  pk in white  clear packaging   and you can wash them in hot and they still don t fade      
710,4.0,                       i am really happy with the fit and style of these shirts  i use them to apply htv and they do a great job  my only complaint is that one of the black shirts in the package has a hole  not sure how i m going to cover it up yet  but other than that annoyance these shirts have been great      
711,1.0,                       x  large runs way way too small  not wearable           
712,2.0,                       i have a few of these shirts from stores and they fit great  ordered a size l like i usually get at a store and this particular manufacture runs very big  the v on this shirt is very excessive  it looks like a women s shirt with the v from shoulder to shoulder and the back of the neck also lays very low below the shoulder line      
713,2.0,                       i got these when they were    for the multipack  i understand why  the shirts were oversized and inconsistent in quality and size  i got a medium            lbs  and they were ridiculously wide  and the neck came down almost down to  my xiphoid process  it was a shame cause the deal seemed too good to be true  and i found out it was        
714,5.0,                         v neck shirts for      i received package in amazon prime s usual   day delivery   all   shirts were rolled up  and taped for easiest possible shipment   went from package to washer   dryer this is the  nd shirt i tried   so far  both shirts had extra string hanging down in armpit area  but that is common   do not rip those strings whatever you do   you will create a hole near the armpit   instead  snip access string with scissors and problem solved i m still amazed how comfortable these shirts are compared to my closet full of under armour ones that cost about   times more  i usually wear large  but ordered xl   thankfully  after washing the shirts in warm water  they fit like a glove   i like these shirts are unbranded    if you are looking for a good fitted shirt  you get   for the price of   ua   i will be buying the   or   pack of black v neck shirts today   they also make these shirts in regular collar too i will give   stars across the board due to price and comfort      
715,3.0,                       good price for a   pack  but definitely too baggy if you wear any type of slim or fitted clothes  it will bunch up in the front  if you re a thinner person maybe look for something more fitted      
716,4.0,                       i followed some other viewers reviews and went a size down  i regret it it s a bit too tight for my comfort  next time i ll order a size up      
717,5.0,                       i wanted these in a large but some of the reviews said the shirts shrink upon washing  so i purchased these in extra large  i wash new clothes before wearing them and after washing the shirts  they are still the same size  now i did order the dark pack so they were washed on cold and i only dry on a medium heat setting  i mention this because shrinking probably happened if the shirts were washed and or dried with hot water high heat  i also live in arizona and cold water in the summer is still quite warm sometimes hot i m a female         lbs so the shirts are quite big but they dont droop off my shoulders or expose my breasts when bending over which i was afraid of  they do seem to attract lint  not a lot and nothing a lint roller can t fix  they still look nice if i at least tuck in the front  so i plan to wear them  overall i m pleased with these shirts  they re very comfortable and it s not their fault i ordered them too big      
718,1.0,                       i bought these because i really love the brand and the way they fit  i purchased a   pack  but only a   pack arrived  beware when ordering  it was a great price for a   pack but not for a   pack  not happy  will not recommend to friends      
719,2.0,                         of the shirts have already started to unravel where they re stitched     shirt came apart after the first wash   i ve literally never owned shirts this poorly made and i m    years old      
720,2.0,                       these t shirts are a great price  but you get what you pay for  the fit is almost like a lady s blouse  that s the only way to describe them  i ve seen some v necks that aren t so low  but these have a huge v neck  i expected better from gildan  but didn t get it with this order  sent them back      
721,5.0,                       very soft and comfortable  i m a female that typically wears m or l unisex t s  and i bought the xxl pack to wear as sleep shirts  i love having something very loose and cozy to sleep in  and these are perfect for that  definitely recommend      
722,5.0,                       some reviews mentioned the shirts were too long  this was the reason i bought them  i prefer a long time undershirt  i also like the softness of the material  i do not like to buy things made in china  these were made in honduras  i highly recommend them     
723,2.0,                       ok so it is an undershirt and it is cheap so there is that  i understand what people are saying when they question if these are factory rejects    of my shirts had a stain and the neck size was as if it was made for a different size shirt  i do think all the necks of each shirt vary in size  the product is inconsistent  but this one was way off  i might not have noticed the others being different if i wasn t specifically looking at them due to this shirt still they are better than the hanes i bought which i am trying to return due to their fabric being so thin it is see through      
724,5.0,                       bought this package of   for my   sons   both wear a medium   it was a bit large on both of them  but wearable   the material isn t as soft as some of their other shirts  but those shirts also cost quite a bit more   great value for the price      
725,5.0,                       these can be worn as under shirts or by themselves  lightweight but not too thin  they worked great for my husband who shirt of choice is a basic black tee      
726,4.0,                       definitely price     can t be beat   these are light weight  comfortable  and did not significantly shrink upon first washing   however  i will warn you to use dryer sheets  bounce  or they will be heavily wrinkled      
727,3.0,                       these shirts are ok  but i have found similar ones with much softer material  also  after wearing them i ve noticed they get a little misshaped weirdly to the point where it looks like i have a bigger stomach where the material is bulging for no reason  i ll probably just keep these shirts for workouts or yardwork      
728,4.0,                       i bought the pack of t shirt to wear with a bomber jacket  i like the color choices as they reflect to the pictures  my only gripe of the t shirts as they are wide from the package  i mean the t shirts are loose from the package  if you workout and or in decent shape then they ll be loose  i threw one into the washer and they significantly shrunk and now they are more fitted to my body if you like the shirt loose then buy your normal shirt size even if you throw them into the washer as they will fit a bit better snug than from the package      
729,3.0,                       i like them however they are super thin   i guess the days of a nice thick t shirt are long gone because i seriously can t find a super great quality thick t shirt anywhere anymore     
730,4.0,                       i sought out this brand because in the past they were thicker than others  seems that is no longer the case  they still seem to be slightly better than hanes brand      
731,4.0,                       i ve been looking for a nice v neck t shirt that doesn t cost a fortune  nor plunge down to my naval  this fits well as an undershirt or just wearing around as a t  the v neck could be a tad bit smaller  but it s better than all the others i ve purchased  will probably order another pack soon      
732,5.0,                       use these for work shirts  a kitchen so they need to breathe  have absolutely no issues with these and are my preferred brand      
733,1.0,                       not only did everyone of these tee shirts come with small holes in them they were marked with tape so you knew there were holes in them  i will be getting a refund but having to go through the whole refund thing is a hassle   i guess what upset me most was they knew about the hole enough to mark them with tape and sent them anyway  the price was just ok   i bought for the convenience and was way disappointed      
734,5.0,                       my husband really like the fit of this undershirt  i wish he would let me take a picture on him to see how nice fits     
735,1.0,                       i get vnecks because i like a nice snug shirt  this was huge like   sizes to big i just wasted almost    dollars on a    dollar purchase im pretty mad right now  i will never wear these  which really sucks because theyre really comfy shirts    im   feet tall and     ibs fit but a large shouldnt be like a bed sheet on me
