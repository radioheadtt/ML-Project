0,1.0 ,                       biggest pile of tech garbage in recent memory   this product is a total fail   i bought this to try and get slightly better signal to one of my ring floodlight cameras   placed approximately    feet away from the camera on the opposite side of the garage wall my ring gets no connectivity with this extender yet connects and works almost perfectly connected directly to my router which is   walls away inside the house and all the way through the garage   embarrassing to say the least   returning for a refund and will just continue to use the connection to my router      
1,2.0 ,                       not really sure how this device works  but it seemed to slow the other traffic that were using the wireless router  also  i bought    and the bandwidth and security wap version was different  using it  insecure network messages for the wifi were observed on one of the devices  i configured them the same as well  it must have been an older device   but they looked the same  both devices i updated the firmware  and made sure my configuration wasn t to blame  no matter what  one of the devices wouldn t work as secure   wpa     vs wpa      in the end  they didn t boost our network speeds  nor improved the communication with the router   family didn t want to use them  so bit of a waste        
2,5.0 ,                       provides great coverage in my apartment  my router is about    feet away from my back room  which is an absolute dead zone  this extender fixed that completely  i also like that the extender can use the same passwords as your router s   very handy if you can t be asked to create a whole new key the price is reasonable  and i was able to recieve it next day  i could not recommend this product enough      
3,2.0 ,                       do not buy this  initially this worked great  after a little trouble setting it up i had a solid month of great performance  i slowly began to realize the issues  however as soon after a month i had to restart the device around   times a week in order to get connected  and just recently i completely lost functionality with the    ghz band  i can not connect to it with my ps   laptop or cellphone  i researched the problem and found no solid solution  only outraged customers on their support page who have not received ample help  i have tried updating it as well  i am currently attempting to return this product and buying an asus product   netgear s competitors update  looked in to returning  and who knew it would stop working just days after the warranty period is up  anyone else have the same issue  please do not buy this      
4,4.0 ,                       installation with the included step by step instructions was very straightforward and easy to understand   ghz range is weak through walls but great for line of sight applications  can also be used as an access point which gives this device great flexibility  firmware settings allow you to choose which frequency to extend and which frequencies to use as backhaul to the router  my wifi connection was inconsistent before using this range extender  now it is very stable and maintains close to my previous max speeds of     mbps  i wish netgear explained how to orient the antennas because that could help optimize the signal strength  as well as if both antennas transmit     and   ghz or if each antenna is dedicated to a frequency band      
5,1.0 ,                       this has been completely awful for me as a working product  it was a hassle to set up and took three attempts  changing nothing in my method all three times  i followed the instructions perfectly and on my third attempt  it finally took i had it plugged in about     from my router after setting it all up and it was awful and it made my existing wifi network even slower  for those of you that don t know   this device creates another network to connect to  for us  connecting to it is pointless  it has helped with nothing and then  netflix and other streaming services struggled and constantly buffered  even when i used an ethernet cable directly from my router to my smart tv  as soon as i unplug the extender   everything works fine again and the speed is back to normal  this product has done completely opposite of what it is supposed to do  it made matters worse and it s been thrown in our junk drawer      
6,5.0 ,                       real simple to set up to my rotten router  it s the service avaible in my area  you see   after a prolonged battle with myprovider i shall not name  wish   their techs found yes indeed there was a repair  two sets of techs    days later   the final guy said  buy yourself an extender and don t bother paying more  than what i did  for it   so   simple set up online  there s a free app to monitor  check wifi performance  still do not get perfection  but it s the area  from experience i well know the other main provider is actually worse to deal with      
7,5.0 ,                       this device was just what i was looking for and i was happy that since i have a netgear wifi router  the device is also netgear   i had just built a new deck in the backyard and plugged in my google mini speaker and noticed it has some latency and short stops like buffering     this solved the issue   setup was done in same room as my router  then unplugged and plugged back in at rear bedroom and i did have a new wifi network name for the new device but same password as the main router      
8,5.0 ,                       i found it easy to set up  just follow the directions and be patient i m amazed that people couldn t figure out how to set it up  i m not gonna type out what i think of those folks  their intelligence  or lack of it s easy to set up  it might take two tried to connect to your router  make sure you wait until all lights are solid green  if it doesn t connect within a millisecond  relax and wait a full second  sheesh the thing works really well for me      
9,4.0 ,                       in general  this extender was not too difficult to setup   i tried using the wps setup several times at different ranges  mostly in the same room where the router is with no success   used the web browser setup  results were flaky  with the unit showing as having an unsecured    ghz line and a secured  ghz line   since setting up a wifi door bell  this wouldn t work out   so  reset the extender  placed within   foot of the router  and tried the wps setup again   this time worked perfectly  with both     and  ghz lines functioning  passwords correct for the ext connections   don t assume won t work  try different positions      
10,3.0 ,                       the instructions that come with the device have nothing to do with how one should set this device up  the standard way is to find the device your smart phone  the iphone will send you to the set the extender up but you must plug in the device and follow the start up directions  but going to mywifiext net won t get you there  netgear you need to revise you complicated and incorrect directions customer service was helpful  it just took too long to set something up that should have been much simpler      
11,2.0 ,                       i was excited to get an extender as my modem router wifi router combo unit could only be located in one room in our house  which was on one side of the house and not central to the rooms we would be needing wifi coverage we have several devices in our home to utilize wifi  including our phones  appletv  smart plug devices  cameras  and more  so needless to say  the bandwidth requirements may have decent demand during peak times of the day  but it s not above normal usage i m writing this review to update you all with my experience after   months of ownership  the first six months the product has worked as advertised  it was easy to install  and also easy to pair with my isp modem  the indicator lights on the extender work well and are clearly visible  i installed the device in the most central part of our home  and was still within    feet of our modem router wi fi router combo unit  installing the extender confirmed it had very good signal strength from the modem up until now the extender has served its purpose adequately  with the occasional hiccups that required a phone  laptop  or media device to reconnect to the extender  today  all of my devices are experiencing slower network speeds  and more frequent interruptions and disconnects  realizing netgear offered a    day warranty on their product  i should ve known prior to purchase that this would last that long  this was a regrettable purchase  and i encourage shoppers to look elsewhere for their wifi coverage solutions      
12,1.0 ,                       i bought this to extend my wifi range for my outdoor cameras   it worked ok i thought  but periodically my    gz network would stop working   i thought it was my router   i went through   routers until i found out what it was   my latest router is a medialink ac      they have great support and helped me figure out that this extender was using half the bandwidth of the    gz network  so instead of extending my range it was breaking it   i finally just unplugged this and magically my    gz network is working great   though my camera that is furthest away has small issues still   they suggested a power line extender   i will try that and see what happens   i guess this cheap extender is the old adage  you get what you pay for      
13,5.0 ,                       this has totally changed my wifi strength  i have my router on the lower level of the house  i have ps  and a computer on the lower level    computers on the upper level and   cell phones  the house is about      sq ft   before the extender the   computers internet was sooooooo sluggish  i just installed the wifi extender and now i have full bars on all devices  a must have        
14,5.0 ,                       omg this is great   we wanted to purchase one from verizon  but then we saw this device for a fraction of the price  we decided to give it a try  and i m happy we did       recommended by a very picky customer      
15,2.0 ,                       last week  i bought a new wifi range extender ac    because i almost used netgear for my home network such as wgr    and c       set up netgear router and modem were very easy  they have been works very smooth and very safe  now it s make me very sad when i waste   days tried to set up  wifi range extender ac      it s very very hard  to set up   at first   i added mac address of ac    in the access list of my cable modem router  after i  connected  ac     then i found   stranges mac addresses that automatic add in the access list of modem router  they have not show the name  it s only mac address    a little bit worry but i still be keep the strange mac addresses in my modem router  i  think  may be the ac    created the strange mac addresses     the ac    wifi connect to the router easy and fast but never  get the internet service   all wireless devices  such as kindle fire  hd  some roku  tv  iphone    and laptops   all them can not get the internet service by wifi range extender ac       i tried one by one    i am very tired then i tried the last chance that i called to the netgear tech support  two india technicians  lady and man  didn t  help me anything  it s very sad when the man technician blamed me that he can not help me because language communication  although i almost done exactly his requests  at the end  he gave me the support case number             i really want to use the full set of netgear device but it s very hard  belief  the most important thing that i lost after i called the netgear tech support  i should be return this product  i am very satisfy with netgear modem router so  i hope the other netgear products should be good and easy to use like that  thanks at first  i m appreciate amazon service to exchange the same product ac     then i tried to set up netgear extender ac     i am very surprise the second exchange product that took only ten hours to ship to my home  i am always satisfy with amazon service thanks i tried the second netgear range extender ac     everything happened same the first one  the most important i found  that this product do not open the router signal the light off  if the base  modem router turn on the access control  although i  added the mac of ac    into the access list  if the router signal of ac    works the internet speed  is very very slow   i m so very sad but i have to return all the netgear range extender ac    one more times  i m appreciated  to amazon service        
16,5.0 ,                       this was easy to setup and the connection was easier  i prefer this to the cheaper no name brand that i bought that always seems to be trying to connect to someplace even when i don t have any devices trying to connect     which always made me worried  unlike the cheaper extender  this one has a website that you can use which makes tech support better  i didn t review tech support because i did not need it      
17,5.0 ,                       i was expecting a powerful extender due to others reviews but i was impressed on how easy it was to configure  i have a att home base and wifi signal is weak  but with the ac    now signal reach the lower part of the house and all without lan cable  after initial power up  with a few steps it was transmitting a powerfull wifi signal  all buttons are designed for easy access  even without instructions manual you can understand what the button or light signal is for  i m very happy with the investment  i purchased a second and will install it with cat  cable to a home office  i will update how it goes  i recommend this unit      
18,1.0 ,                       i tried multiple times to connect via my wps   and it would not work   the extender was very close to the router   since that did not work  i attempted to link it via the web  and that also wouldn t work   the web address provided in the instructions did not work   then the link i was directed to wouldn t even open   could not find the site horrible instructions and bad experience   i won t be getting another netgear item      
19,3.0 ,                       netgear used to be solid  quality  consumer grade hardware but has been lackluster in recent experiences   one of my small business clients has gone through three routers in a year  not a power issue   no other devices have had issues  and i ve been experiencing substandard performance with this small range extender   the room in which the device is installed is approximately     from the router  netgear r      and signal doesn t get through reliably without an extender   i ve lately been noticing facetime call drops that appear to be on my end  and i have occasional video buffering  youtube  amazon instant video  netflix    there are iphones  ipads  and an xbox one that are on wifi  but only the xbox is streaming video   the other devices are simply surfing the web   victony seems to have good equipment   i probably should ve gone that route  but the netgear was a little cheaper      
20,5.0 ,                       our internet coverage is spotty at best within our home   thought i d give the netgear ac    a shot after reading the positive reviews   let me say    it works   followed the setup instructions and then placed it in the center point of our house on the first floor   wifi is not not an issue at all   my kids have great signal strength on the second floor and now we even have a strong signal on our porch   something we never had before   great product      
21,3.0 ,                       this is weird as i had to return the product   i had needed it only to extend the signal for some exterior wifi security cameras and it wasn t working with that   turns out not compatible with my security camera brand   i hadn t known that on the initial purchase  i contacted tech support on amazon and they verified this doesn t work with my brand and we arranged a return and identified the product i do need  which i hadn t found via my search  so tech support invaluable here    so can t verify anything except the wifi connection was done easily  as i have a wps button  but the device connection never worked for me      
22,5.0 ,                       i chose this unit over the amazon recommended ex     because of its dual band capability  i opened and plugged the adapter and it took me about   minutes flat to have it up and running  extremely easy to set up  and the wifi signal throughout my house has increased tremendously  the only thing to keep in mind is that this is an extender  not a repeater   so i went from having two signals on my network   g    g  to having four   g ext and  g ext   what this really means is that you have to set up every network separately in your devices  you can even have four different passwords      
23,4.0 ,                       i needed something to boost my signal and this fit the bill   it s easy to set up and connection is simple   i live in an old house and my cable modem router is set up at one end   the signal in my bedrooms upstairs was very limited   i installed this in a room in the front of the house on the first level and it helped   my smart tv upstairs wasn t getting a wifi signal before and this allowed me to use netflix without issues so far   i do notice from time to time that the lights on the device indicate it s lost connection to the router  but it doesn t seem to affect the signal for the tv   it definitely helps and is worth the money      
24,1.0 ,                       i bought this extender thinking it was a good company to deal with  i was very wrong  it is claimed to be plug and play  not for me  it wasn t  i called what i thought was tech support  what it boiled down to be was a scam  at first  it was going to be           for   years support   then the price was going to for three years of support  finally  i was told   for one year the charge to connect me was             is this how a business is to be run  i am not a vy happy with amazon or netgear      
25,2.0 ,                       worked well for first   months   then  x often it would perform poorly and required a reboot   after that  i got it on a daily reboot  wifi plug    that worked for   months  now it requires  x per day reboot   with mixed results   as you can tell i have been patient  buying a different one  interestingly  my wifi ap is a netgear     that works very reliably      
26,5.0 ,                       we changed cable providers and now all of are computers are wireless  my husband s had been hard wired in the past  so with the new provider he felt like the signal was slower as the wi fi box is now on the lower level instead of in his office i really did not want to change cable providers again  as we are satisfied  and paying much less  than we were with our previous service  i thought that a range extender may help out as alexa was also having difficulty getting a good signal it was easy to set up and now my hubby s computer is much quicker loading  also  alexa is not having difficulty  so we are all happy          
27,5.0 ,                       we got this because our router would not work with our firestick connected to the tv one floor down  once setting this up and putting it on the same floor with the firestick  it works great  we haven t had a problem getting netflix to play since  i m very happy with this thing  my bf set it up and says that he couldn t do it with his desktop but using the smartphone it set up in a snap  we had to set the firestick to forget the router s original network so it will only go to the extender  since it kept switching back and having the same problems as before  if you re having trouble getting this to work  maybe try setting your device to forget the old router network and only use the extender s      
28,2.0 ,                       i got the ac     this product was relatively easy to set up  lights turned green when they were supposed to and the one button push set up went smoothly  unfortunately  the product did not work for me  while it extended the signal it slowed it down greatly  my devices hooked up to it easily and showed full bars but then videos would not stream  pages would not load  and it generally did not work  i got a better signal going back to the original router than i did going through the extender  long story short  it does not live up to the hype      
29,5.0 ,                       adding an amazon fire tv stick to our tv was a fine idea  but we had very slow internet response  my granddaughter suggested this product  so i bought it  installation was a bit tricky for this    year old  non techie great grandmother  but i did get it figured out  it has helped a great deal      
30,4.0 ,                       so i know people see this product from different perspectives and it s fine  if you don t have patience  or don t know what you are doing  or get all your info from youtube tutorials  that might be the cause of your frustration and why this product doesn t work for you  maybe call a professional in any case  my opinion is this product is pretty straight forward to setup if you have patience and have experience setting up even basic wifi connections at home  it s not a professional product  so don t expect miracles also if you are trying to use this extender for a large house  or apartment with concrete cinder block walls  forget it  you definitely need more than one  to keep extending the range and you need to place each in logical location  away from microwaves  cordless phones  security wifi devices  etc  also try to place it in open spaces  like hallways or rooms that aren t cluttered  it extends your current signal  it doesn t just magically make a new wifi signal for you if you need more than one  that is fine  some homes will require a mesh of several units to works best  just remember don t get frustrated  just because it doesn t work like you think it should work right away  it does take some patience and basic network knowledge to get it going just like you want it to you can always post a question and i m sure someone will respond to you and help you figure things out      
31,5.0 ,                       needed a wifi extended to provide a better wifi signal to my ring doorbell  unfortunately  the location of my router was too far from the ring and the signal had to travel through too many walls  including the external brick wall  because of the weak signal  i was having trouble answering rings and getting live views on my phone i originally looked into purchasing the ring brand wifi extended  but it was    bucks and it was only for ring products  i thought it would help to have a wifi extender to connect to all my other devices  so i scoured amazon to find a cheaper one i am technologically literate in many areas  but connectivity and networks are not one of those areas  i was concerned that i would have to hire a techy person to come help me  but surprisingly  it was very easy to set up and connect with my current at t uverse router i did run into a bit of a problem  as my ring doorbell was still showing a weak signal  i fiddled around with the ring and realized that this extended had created a new network for me to connect to   it was my network name with   ext  at the end  i reconnected the ring to that network   my password was the same and everything   and now my ring doorbell works perfect this extender is great and does exactly what i need i also noticed on the box that there is a phone number to call for      tech support  which is very handy to have i highly recommend it if you just need a boost in signal to reach certain devices or reach devices that are too far away from your router      
32,5.0 ,                       i paid full price        installed easily on the first attempt using the   touch wps button   the   touch feature cannot be used with wep or wpa security   if your existing network uses wep or wpa  you will need to manually configure this extender through your router settings my extender is about    ft from the router through a couple of walls  and provides a full bar signal in my living room where the signal had previously been very weak you can get a free netgear app to help determine the ideal placement  but i haven t used it   the device worked perfectly where i wanted it on the first attempt i ve been using this for   month and am very pleased with it      
33,3.0 ,                       i purchased this to get stronger wifi in my basement  and it works perfectly for that  installing and setting up took me all of     minutes to get it connected to my existing router and plug it in to a place where i could get a decent wifi signal in my basement  when i originally had it plugged in as close to my router as possible for set up  i ran a speed test and got close to about   mbps  this confused me considering the device is supposed to go up to    mbps download speeds  and my internet plan is for    mbps  no matter where i plug it in there is absolutely nothing i can do to get over   mbps  considering before in my basement if i wanted to use wifi it would normally hang out around    mbps    is a huge increase  but i m still disappointed having paid nearly     for this product and not getting what s advertised      
34,3.0 ,                       the product does work but if you live in a house made of concrete  not drywall  the connection will be horrible initially we ordered just one and thought that it would be enough  since our house is not that big    we ended up ordering two additional extenders so we could have the desired connection   even so it seems to be hit and miss sometimes but the range itself is questionable  the distance from our router to the extender had to be less than   ft so it could work  if it was more than   ft you d get a red light on the  router  light on the netgear extender  meaning that the connection with the router was poor nevertheless  we ordered   in total  and kind of have the connection we wanted if you live in a concrete house and want wifi extenders  i d recommend spend some more money to get a good extender that does what it s supposed to do      
35,2.0 ,                       installation was simple  i set it up as  g  g  i e   full speed from router to extender  and full speed from extender to remote device   took my laptop next to where extender was  connected the laptop to the router wifi and measured wifi speed as      mbps  connected to the extender without moving the laptop and speed drops to    mbps  few more tries  sometimes i will get full      mbps  many times low    mbps  connected the tv  reason i bought this thing  and streaming services will freeze and pause every now and then  even netflix  which is rather good at working on bad wifi  gave up  i am returning this in favor of tp link n    extender  model tl wa   re  that is half the price and works great  it doesn t support  ghz channel but i dont care as it delivers full speed and range i need       
36,5.0 ,                       this range extender arrived today i assumed that the wps setup  which only involves pressing a button on the extender and another on the router  would work i was right   so easy   complete in minutes i have a long house with the router in the basement at one end and master bed bath on the first floor at the far end of the home   this is the area that needs the extender problem solved   the extender signal is strong over the entire home even on the second floor farthest from the extender as a bonus  this device is tiny and unobtrusive     
37,2.0 ,                       i ve had this product since       between then and now  i ve always had issues with  it losing connection on any device and download speeds  losing connections was by far the worst issue even though the extender was only feet away from my most used devices  now recently the    ghz randomly stopped working  thinking this was an isolated issue  i decided to come on here to buy a newer model with better specs  but saw some of other reviews   its not isolated  i would give this product   star if it wasn t for the ease of setup  now  i still have to purchase a new extender and i m torn because netgear has always had a easy setup process      
38,4.0 ,                       this is a pretty good product  does what it is supposed to  however  it seems like it causes a ton of signal disruption for my other wifi broadcasters  when i unplug it  seems like my device work better in other areas of my home  this isn t a big deal  i use this for travel so that i can be sure i have a strong signal anywhere i go   this is the perfect device for the travelling it person  all around  happy with this device  just maybe not the best for permanent use in your home      
39,1.0 ,                       simply garbage  took an hour to set up  the wifi doesn t work well at all  it is terrible   waste of money  worst of all  i feel like my home wifi has been compromised      
40,1.0 ,                       nothing but problems   it properly connected to my    g network but when connected to my    g network  it wouldn t access the internet    as in i d have a full strength wireless connection but there was nothing behind it   in addition  i have a    mb sec connection and this device advertises     mb s  it should be more than enough to handle my isp   i ran a speed test on my local    g network as well as    gext network and even on a couple devices and  i was consistently getting only half speed at   mb sec when connected to    gext   needless to say this guy is going back      
41,2.0 ,                       i used this with the intention to extend our network to an rv in the driveway   it improved the signal only marginally but actually caused connectivity issues with other devices in the network   perhaps there were channel congestion issues but there was no easy way to make those kinds of adjustments with this device   user interface was not that easy to use  and very slow   it is possible some of the issues with the interface might have been connection related i eventually bought a google wifi   pack and now have great mesh wifi all across my home  even a good signal in the rv now   if you want a real upgrade and easy set up fantastic wireless in the home  that s the way to go      
42,2.0 ,                       what this did  in effect  was replace one marginal wireless link with two slightly less marginal wireless links   it has to use it s own ssid and password so your devices won t auto switch between this and your router   it is now sitting in a storage tub   solution was to pull some cat  e trough the floor into the garage  across the garage ceiling and poke it through a wall and install a tp link access point  with power over ethernet so no additional wires were required    it still won t auto roam but at least there is only one wireless link  which is solid      
43,5.0 ,                       this fixed our issue  our  g of wifi with verizon service never seemed to work and reach the garage or our daughters rooms above the garage  we assumed it was the medal of garage door openers prohibiting or messing with the wifi signals  i purchased this in hopes it would correct the issues and my daughter now has   bars of wifi and we can listen to our music in the garage without cutting out the service  we placed it in our daughters room  i tried putting it in the garage but that didn t work still  works great now in her room  above the garage and we get signal in our front yard now too with this extender     
44,1.0 ,                       first off  i have no problem with electronics  especially something as basic as a wifi extender   you are limited in options if a problem occurs there are two set up options  wps to wps which should work with the press of a button on the repeater and modem  or connect to the netgear with a wifi device and run the startup from there    if trying one after the other be sure to factory reset between attempts many attempts through both methods always ended the same  all indicator lights proper  the repeater connected to the source wifi  my device able to connect yet the signal the repeater sends out  while strong  is not connected to the internet over an hour on customer service to find one person willing to give any suggestions   still no luck word to the wise  if they want you to set up a service account with electronics this simple  netgear expects them to break and be faulty      
45,1.0 ,                       we had this wifi extender for more than a year   i finally got around to installing it during the pandemic   when you follow the instructions in the booklet to install it takes you to an online address for assistance   this turned out to be a third party site that said that several parties were using my ip address   they asked for      to clean this up for me and provide ongoing  protection    they did assist me in setting up the extender   i paid the     then realized it was a scam and called my credit card company and cancelled   then i called netgear in san jose ca   they claim they never heard this third party   they asked me for money when i wanted them to check if the extender was installed properly    they said that the warrenty was already over so i had to pay   one of their technicians hung up on me and the second one didn t seem to know what he was doing   i m going to try to stop the payment to netgear now   amazon should not carry this company s products period      
46,2.0 ,                       this product does indeed extend your network  but be ready for slow speeds while using it   my wireless router is in my basement and i needed something to help out on the  nd floor      the range has certainly been extended  but you can totally notice when your phone computer switches over the extended network   everything slows waaaaay down     to the point that you want to switch to lte just to get things moving  which obviously defeats the purpose my suggestion would be to save your money and put it towards a wireless mesh system   it will serve you better      
47,5.0 ,                       i m really surprised how easy this was to set up and well it works  my router is at the exact opposite of where i need it to be  i went from constantly losing connection to never get more than half strength if i was lucky on  g for my laptop  even the regular connection never went near full strength and would disconnect  i thought this might help me stay connected  but i wasn t expecting full strength  it is at full capacity on  g and i m so happy   i do have a small house ranch style house  so not sure how this will work in a larger area set up took about   minutes and was so easy  i located my wps button on the router so i would know where to go since i had to plug the extender on the opposite wall  so then  i plugged the extender in  waited for power  pushed the wps on the side  light started flashing ran over to the router and pushed the wps that was lit up  bother router and extender flashed as they connected  i repeated to have access to  g connection  unplugged extender and put about halfway between router and where i use my laptop  it took a minute or so for the green lights to come on showing it was working and i was worried  but i had patience  i went to the laptop and checked connection options  like a glowing beacon of hope  there was the option with the same name as my regular connection  but now ending in  gext  i connected without any problems at all and have been loving life again      
48,1.0 ,                       when i purchased this wifi extender  i thought i made some mistake in configuring it  so i contacted netgear support and received a case number  case             i explained that i had an older netgear wifi extender and it worked with the google fiber box downstairs to connect to my upstairs desktop with its dual band wifi adapter  i purchased this newer extender because i wanted access to g  too  the old one could not do this   the tech told me immediately that this new extender would not work because i did not have a router   send it back   he said  i asked several questions about the configuration  but he simply repeated   send it back   perhaps he was right  i do feel  however  that even the very best devices will fail to find an audience if support is as abysmal as it was in my case      
49,2.0 ,                       i ve had this for about    months  it overheats at least once a week  it s in the bottom floor of my house so heat is not a problem  the  ghz spectrum doesn t always show up on the hotspot list on our laptops phones   ghz is so slow and really only for security systems i would not buy again      
50,4.0 ,                       it works how it s supposed to  but i m not educated enough on this stuff to know everything   so as far as i can tell  the lack of signal in my basement was slightly remedied  but not exceptionally  thanks to this device   it seems to have overall slowed down my entire internet connection at home too   i wasn t anticipating that   again  i m sure it s my own fault for not knowing this well enough   so the device itself works   but it didn t work as well as i d hoped setup was super easy though      
51,1.0 ,                       after multiple attempts to connect extender i signed on to the website shown in netgear  instruction manual  within seconds a chat came up asking for model number which i provided  she immediately told me to type in a website which  unknowingly  allowed her to access my computer  she immedaiately started a scan and showed me i  had a virus called  alureon  which was preventing install of extender and allowed hackers to access my computer  after putting me in fear of having my information stolen she convinced me to spend      to remove the virus  after   hours of allowing remote access the virus was removed and the extender was installed  they then tried to sell me a lifetime virus protection for      which i refused  it should be noted that i have had mcafee since i got the computer but she told me that did not provide necessary protection   my wallet is      lighter and i feel ripped off   and all i can do is hope that all my information  has not been compromised      
52,5.0 ,                       this wifi extender functioned exactly as advertised  i received a new  well packaged product  plugged the extender near the wifi router  the lights lit when connection made  i then placed the extender in a room where i had only been receiving wifi rated marginal to fair with problems and now the rating with this wifi extender is rated very good  i no longer have been losing wifi  highly recommend this product      
53,1.0 ,                       i am a fairly tech savvy person  and after an hour of scouring the netgear community board and faqs and resetting the device to factory settings multiple times  i am giving up and returning it  it appears to work perfectly when connecting the router via wps  but then every time i try to connect a device to either of the new ssids that were created  i m given an  invalid password  response  i tried both the password for my router  and  the password for my wifi network and neither is being accepted  netgear s online support is dismal and i saw a number of others in the community boards experiencing the same issue with no resolution  buyer beware      
54,5.0 ,                       the router was on one end of the house and the deck where my wife hangs out and reads works is on the other and the signal was extremely weak  with this range extender she is able to work and use video with no issues and degradation of service      
55,3.0 ,                       been using one for about a year with satisfactory results  ordered a second one this week  it tried to work for a couple of minutes  then i lost all lights on it and can t communicate with it  the only light on is the amber power  the factory setting does nothing  it is not responsive to anything i can think of  the tech support had nothing interesting to say      
56,3.0 ,                       the extender worked fine for the few months that it worked  one day it was working  the next day it was dead  nothing i did could make a light turn on  i verified the power outlets that i tried did in fact work  i called netgear customer service and they did a great job helping me  they were fast and efficient  a little over the top on verifying and spelling everything out but that is not a negative  i was issued an rma number and the email with instructions arrived before the phone call ended  i m sure the return replacement will go just fine  in the meantime  i upgraded to a netgear nighthawk router and now i really don t need the extender about the extender itself  i ran a network cable to my wife s office  where the previous router signal was low  and used the extender as an access point  set up was easy and it worked great  it worked great until the day it went it died  the extender is a little cheap feeling but the whole thing is pretty small device and most electronics are pretty light these days  if i need an extender access point in the future i ll probably buy a ubiquiti unifi  they are a little more    but worth it  the ops guys at my company all use them at home  you only have to run a network cable to the device as it gets power over the network cable  watch a youtube video on how they work  much easier to watch a vid than type it out      
57,1.0 ,                       mine followed all the instructions and would to all appearences have seemed to be working  but by direct effect  and then by formal testing with an appropriate signal strength testing app   even with a direct line of site between the router and the range extender  the reach of my original router was actually greater  and the signal strength higher  than the strength of the signal from the range extender  probably the most tricky part was that the extender will appear to be working  the directions that come with it are quite good  so if you get it   and it may be that i do have a bad unit   be sure to also download your favorite signal strength testing app  the one that comes referenced with it is out of date and no longer maintained  so get a third party one in your app store       
58,5.0 ,                       we have guests in an upstairs bedroom and they were not getting wifi very well at all   so i bought this netgear extender had it plugged in and working within about    minutes of getting it   i tried one plug not far from the router first  and it gave a better signal to the furthest room  but not great   so i moved it again to my bedroom upstairs and down the hall from the furthest bedroom from the router   and it has worked very well since  the guests have been able to stream movies in their room without hang ups which they could not do at all before   it is great because it extends both the guest network and the  g network   about two times in the two months that i have had it  the green lights have gone yellow and the extender has stopped working  but if we just unplug it and plug it back in  it is back up within   minutes so far we are happy with it   it has lived up to its claims and has been reliable day in and day out for weeks at a time      
59,1.0 ,                       i had a difficult time setting this up  and once i did  it worked very well   i was getting speeds over    mbs  super fast       for about a day   then all of the lights went red  and i could not re connect   i reset the unit  tried wps  and everything else   it never worked again   i replaced the unit with another one and after one and a half hours  i could not get it to connect  another epic failure   it was very frustrating  and a waste of time   i have returned it and ordered something else      
60,4.0 ,                       we have a security camera in a motion sensor light on our front door  the camera kept going offline supposedly because the camera was more than    feet from the router with more than   wall in between  i bought this unit to place next to the front door to give the camera a better signal  after installing the extender on my router  a completely easy and no problem task and connecting the camera to the extender the picture and sound from the camera were better  especially the sound with no sound pauses  we ll see if this solves the problem of the camera going offline and needing someone at home to reset it      
61,1.0 ,                       the browser setup instructions give you a website to go to  you can t connect to the website  do a search  and you can find the  right  website  chat pops up  problem discussed about the website  says he ll have a technician call me  technician calls me  asks how many lights on the extender  i say one  he says he needs access to my pc so he can set up my extender  i said no  obviously   then he said my extender was bad and i had to send it back    i said  you re a techinician  he hung up   chat is still up  so i go back to that guy and he says the tech has to remote log in to my computer and there will be charges  i told him extenders are typically easy to set up  he and his buddy are running a scam and if he can t help for free  then the conversation is over  he said   okay    set up   so after i left the scammers behind  i hooked the extender up to the router with an ethernet cable  logged in to the netgear website for the extender on my phone and set up the extender in a few easy steps  note   i have the netgear genie app on my pc but i couldn t see the extender until i plugged it directly into the router with the ethernet cable  i ran across instructions to set up on an android device which is why i used the phone to set it up  if i poked around long enough  i probably could have done it on the pc  maybe even through the netgear app the extender is working great right now  but netgear really needs to simplify the setup and tighten up security on their website      
62,3.0 ,                       bought this to boost signal in home office which is about    feet from router located on a different floor  speedtest without extender was     mb s  and    mb s with extender   contacted tech support and they said the extender was located at maximum range   extender description does not indicate range limitations only that it covers      ft   which in my case   i feel  was deceptive   i gave it   stars because i thought tech support was good   otherwise i would have given it   star      
63,3.0 ,                       had this for   months and i wish i hadn t missed the return window  support is responsive but couldn t make it better for me  my smartphone stays connected when i go sit outside in my patio but my laptop refuses to  even after doing everything tech support recommended  and the unit is plugged in my kitchen by the door to the patio      from router in living room      
64,1.0 ,                       this product is not safe  i used it and optimum did not let the network go through   yes it moves fast but you won t get the internet especially from optimum because optimum wants you to buy their internet speed and this product won t let the optimum internet get through  also note netgear is a scam that uses this device to steel your internet information like your bank s accounts apps and your personal profiles   i went to their website and my phone had an i  icon on it that indicated that website is not trustworthy for they can steel your personal information like i said earlier  listen to your phone if it said the network such as netgear is untrustworthy   your phone would notify you about how insecure this network product is  so i went to their site netgear  and you can see that the site was poorly setup   and above your phone screen if their is not an lock icon and you see an i  icon on the top of your screen on your phone that mean the website is not trustworthy   please stay away from this product   i hope amazon in the future would analyze these products and make sure it s safe to sell products to people  everything you do on the internet netgear would see it if you link this product with the fake website and activate their wifi network   i disconnected this horrific product and dumped it where it belongs  if people say this product is great i wouldn t trust them please please don t buy this   it s a scam product  it works real fast offline but don t let it operate online with their website ok  for now on do your research online go to youtube or google your product before you buy   i hope you listen      
65,4.0 ,                       okay  this device improved the wifi signal issue at my house but it is not a miracle extender   i noticed this thing is not too good at extending signal through walls or floors  the wifi router at my house is downstairs at one end of the house and i was getting barely   to   bars at  nd floor bedroom at the opposite end of the house sometimes cutting out  with the extender about middle of the house on the  nd floor stairwell  i don t have the signal cutting out problem anymore and i get consistent   to   bars so that s good  however  bedrooms on the  st floor below do not see the same result  they get   bars  still better or same as without the extender   i ll just have to get another one for the  st floor that s all  all in all  i like the device   easy to set up and move it around  not too expensive  well known brand name  etc  i bought the   year protection for       just in case      
66,4.0 ,                       like the title states  its a good little wifi extender thats easy to install  however you are not going to get    mbs using it as a repeater  first you should know how fast your current internet speed you are getting from your isp  and your router  if you are using it as a repeater   not connected directly to your router via long ethernet cable  your wifi speed will be greatly reduced  not bad if you are using it for internet browsing on you cell phone  or streaming tv   mbps for standard definition   mbps for streaming in  k   if you want to get the most out of this or any wifi extender  you will need to use it as an access point  which requires a long ethernet cable to go from your router  to the wifi extender  this will give you the best and highest wifi speed in the area this wifi extender is installed  enjoy      
67,4.0 ,                       would have given a   except for the set up   i m now getting a strong signal throughout the entire house and hope the unit lasts a while   the set up was  as is usual  a little vague   the usual unexpected deviations from the instructions and problems came up as they always do with products like this   i hate it when what i see on the screen doesn t match up with what is in the instructions   worked my way through it for about an hour and finally got it set up for both     and     bands   based on the directions  you should be able to add both bands at once  but it failed every time   decided to just try one  and it finally hooked up with the router   when i checked for available wifi  i then found both bands available even though i hadn t actually asked for the second one   go figure         
68,3.0 ,                                   works great so far setup was actually pretty simple after i read and re read the instructions a few times to make sure i understood what to do  first i plugged the device into an outlet in the same room as the router   as instructed  turned on the device and waited for it to boot up and whatever  pressed the wps button on the router and waited a few minutes for the device to connect to the network  mighta had to press a button on the device for this as well   once all the pretty lights were happy  i unplugged the extender  took it to the room i wanted it in  plugged it in  waited a couple minutes for the pretty lights to be happy again  then started connecting all my devices to the networks the tv went from     signal strength to       and the blu ray player went from     to       streaming amazon videos and netflix videos was a huge problem before i got this device  now both services stream great so far on both devices would i trust my mom to be able to setup this device  nope  i still have to connect her new devices to her network whenever i visit  but i d say for the most part if you take your time  go step by step  have the wps option on your router  and are somewhat familiar with connecting devices to your network  you should be able to get through the process  took about    minutes to go from the box to   phones    tv  a blu ray player  and   laptops connected            update  lately i ve noticed a huge decrease in download speeds on the wifi range extender  no network changes have been made  speeds are down across all devices  have tested speeds using a couple apps and online services  wifi directly through the router is considerably higher than through the extender  router download         mbps  extender download        mbps      
69,4.0 ,                       off the bat  its really easy to hook up to your router using wps  but  using the browser based website to set it up is basically out of the question  it requires internet for you to be able to load it correctly and even with internet  netgear s support servers are so slow  the webpage times out     of the time  if you are using it in the configuration of putting it as another access point that is connected via ethernet  then please tell me how you did it  i have had this thing for a month and still can t set it up that way because of the aforementioned webpage problem  still give it a   star cause it has some pretty good wifi signal     
70,4.0 ,                       install was fairly straight forward  i am using it in access point mode  so that i don t have multiple wifi networks for my internet  and that involved some  advanced  settings to be changed  however this was all handled fairly simply via the netgear extender website but did require some googling  overall the signal is strong and definitely expanded my network though out my house  where i was once getting    mbps  even though i have  gbps through att  i am now getting a consistent     mbps to my iphone    pro  and for     that isn t a bad trade off  the only way i could get closer to my att advertised  gbps would be with mesh systems that cost upwards of      and even then i think it would only be a slight upgrade  highly recommended though  would give   stars if not for the somewhat cumbersome setup process      
71,3.0 ,                       purchased this product with the hope that it would extend wifi throughout our  l  shaped home   it s performance was below average at best when used as a  wifi extender  paired with our router as the wifi would go out  we weren t able to connect to networks  etc   i was about to give up on this extender when i decided to run a flat ethernet cable directly from our router into it and then use it as an  access point    once i did that  our problems were solved   now we are getting fast  reliable wifi in our home   that s just our experience  maybe you ll have better luck      
72,2.0 ,                       netgear wifi range extender ex     i brought a new product  the product came in with one of the clear circle seal broken already  the other was still seal  i will try it out and see how it work  i will update the star after i test it out      
73,1.0 ,                       impossible   hours and hours spent with the device  with techs  not netgear techs    netgear asks for the serial number   i cannot read it with close focus glasses and a magnifying glass   going to the netgear site reveals downloads that require zip file opening   i do not have zip  and i am not going to buy it   setting up with the wps button on the wireless router lights up the  required leds   but the network extended names do not appear when the wireless system is opened on a pc   searched fruitlessly over and over   this is an insult to buyers and  users      
74,4.0 ,                       i will preface this review by saying that i have built the computers in my house the server in my house and i ve configured my router and my cell phone booster  i m no stranger to how this stuff works  however this unit is a nightmare to install  i went through the process several times and didn t get the notifications the unit was supposed to give me to say that it was configured  the only way that i knew i had done it correctly was that the unit showed up connected to my router  the average person is not going to be happy and might not even be able to install this       
75,2.0 ,                       i have a small apartment i used it to help with dead zones  it worked a week  i have a router and cable box in my living room not very far from the bedroom where i have a     toshiba tv  with a fire stick attached  it just doesn t work with my spectrum tv account   i am sick and tired of resetting it  btw all the lights are on green too and the added ext     ext    it s not workable like everything elsethese rip off companies tell you   don t buy it      
76,1.0 ,                       i have other netgear products  and because i consider the router to be good  nighthawk ac       i decided to buy this wifi extender   the problem is that the signal from the router is inconsistent which that makes the extender to disconnect several times    i am tech savvy so there s nothing to do with its channel  location or speed   i have excellent internet speed     the second issue is that when the extender works  its range is poor and the speed is not as fast as the product promises   i called netgear  and they just wasted my time   they will claim that the problem is the customer and their product is flawless   haven t i learned yet that netgear customer support is useless      so now i am back in a search for a decent wifi extender   i accept recommendations if you feel like leaving some in the comments   i do not recommend this product  or any other netgear product   i will be looking for a brand to replace my negtear items  including my router and my modem    i feel disrespected as a customer      
77,5.0 ,                       i was expecting a struggle connecting this to my network because i have to get a ladder and climb    feet to get to my router   this connected with little effort to my linksys ea     router   no ladder was required   there was no need to physically push a button on my router   sometimes included instructions make installation sound more difficult than it is   also  i had no problem connecting my new outdoor smart plug to this range extender   i am very happy with this purchase      
78,5.0 ,                       we upgraded cable internet service  from     to  up to      mbps  and only need about       upload download bandwidth to get uninterrupted hd streaming video  yet i was still getting lousy wifi signal from the new router in the two family home apartment living room to my nearby bedroom through     sets of walls corners  gasping at       mbps and dropping intermittently during peak volume times like   and    and    pm  etc   where i occasionally work from home and often stream music and video and browse multiple tabs  in despair and after cursory research into booster repeater extender and models ranging from  why bother  to  who can afford that   i took a chance on this mid priced workhorse  hallelujah  it s exactly what was needed  easy set up  and i m now getting consistent        speeds with the old     laptop plugged into the ethernet jack and the cell connecting on the  g ext  and with myriad devices in other rooms drawing off the shared wifi signal   this proved just the right solution to the problem   well worth the investment      
79,2.0 ,                       mostly works well and has a better signal than the old wrt  g w ddwrt that i used to use as a repeater  it also supports simultaneous      ghz repeating only real problem that i have is that rarely it will say it s connected with a good signal but nothing connecting to it can access my network or the internet  it usually resolves itself  but it s annoying  i also don t like the silly setup system  which makes it easier to set up for the average person but actually harder for anyone experienced with network equipment overall  a good value and it works pretty well  i d say it s still more reliable than the old powerline networking system that i used to have set up a few years ago edit            got sick of this thing flaking out  it works fine when first plugged in  but gets into some error state and stops bridging networks or something so that anything that connects to it can t access anything or get an ip  i know it s a problem with the extender and not the signal  because the jack on the extender still has a good connection to the network i ve replaced it and will likely never use it again unless i m desperate  i got some moca adapters and an old dual band ddwrt router that i had  and set up an access point instead  it works much better and is much faster      
80,5.0 ,                       the wi fi extender works great  the only problem i had was that i couldn t connect to the wi fi extender thru my window laptop  it keep disconnecting from it so i could not configure it  i had to register with netgear and i got free support  once i register and open a ticket  i called in and i spoke to someone very quickly  i provided them the ticket number and the person helped me out  they ended up using my ipad to connect to my wi fi extender and after that it i was able to setup and configure  once it was completed  i moved it to the hall way and i have not had a problem with it i bought this because i purchased a ring floodlight cam that was connected to my wi fi network but since i was getting low signal strength i purchased this and it works with out a problem  i am able to get my ring floodlight cam connected to my wi fi without any issues highly recommended this netgear wi fi extender      
81,4.0 ,                       i needed to get wifi into my garage for car firmware updates   i set up one of these and it works fine   it s not super fast  but it doesn t have to be one tip i should share is that if you are using a phone to do the initial setup  turn off your mobile network   the phone will attempt to connect to the internet and bypass the extender s network   this leads to frustrating  cryptic  you are not connected to the extender  messages  despite the fact that you really are connected to the extender      
82,2.0 ,                       i bought this extender three months ago   it never worked properly  i had to re set it almost daily   the initial set up was with the help of a company s tech and it took about    minutes  the call is routed outside of the country and sometimes it s difficult to understand the heavy accent of the rep   she was very pleasant and willing to help though   after this much time  and not being able to use wifi in my sunroom  i called netgear again   it took    minutes to finally find out that the extender was broken   she offered to replace it but i had to return the old one and pay shipping and handling to return it   i called amazon and started the return process at no cost   will look for a better product      
83,5.0 ,                       the netgear wifi range extender ex     was just so easy to configure and was very pleased with the wifi speeds that i was streaming movies in my back yard in hd   wow bear in mind  when you initially connect to it  you will have to leave your network so this task can easily be accomplished with a smart phone i am an i t  professional and i would recommend this to everyone      
84,2.0 ,                       i bought this to extend the range of the only wi fi router in the house  it was a real pain to set up following the instructions in the booklet  the correct sequence of leds just wouldn t light up at first  after i got it to work  i put it in the kitchen but it repeatedly disconnected  even while initially showing a good connection   ultimately  the constant resetting turned out to be more of a hassle than it was worth  the connection quality was abysmal  i ended up just buying a real router and creating another access point and am much happier with those results      
85,2.0 ,                       the unit was fairly easy to setup  it initially complained about the password but it eventually went away  the wifi signal is ok but the internet speed is horrible and it defeats the main purpose of installing this  i have my router in my living room  the extender is located immediately upstairs  so about    ft from the router  orange light indicates poor connection  on a speed test i get    mbos without the extender and   mbos with it  i m returning this junk     
86,2.0 ,                       so far  terrible experience  i installed per the instruction manual in the box  easy enough  chose alternate ssid config  page   of the user guide   installed firmware update  and everything installed relatively easily  however  the signal strength is terrible  i ve tried    g and  g with the extender in multiple locations in my house   no improvement  actually  when i use the extender the wifi network performance for that device is much  much worse  with the extender  with an all green connection to the router  i m getting    mb download speed  w   g ext connection  and when i connect directly to the  g wifi  not the through extender  i get    mb download speed  so  something isn t working right    the bottleneck is now somehow the extender  in addition  the signal strength to the device i connect to the extender rapidly cycles from  poor  red to  good  amber  and sometimes no connection  at less than    ft away from the extender   i ve tried two completely different wifi adapters on the device i m connecting to the extender  so far  i don t yet see any upside to this device  it doesn t work for me  good luck  i think i m going to return this unit  maybe i got a bad unit because this one is practically useless      
87,1.0 ,                       waste of money   do not buy   i went through   of these devices   i have a small nyc apartment   i have great wifi in my bedroom  but horrible service in my living room   i bought the extender to  extend  my network into the living room   for the first unit  i called netgear and the rep couldn t figure out what was wrong with the device  there was no difference in speed   so she told me i would get a new device just send back this one first  at my expense    so i did  out more money    i just got the  nd device   this time i called netgear for step by step directions in the initial set up   did several speedtest s to show i have good wifi   still could not get the device to work properly   my service did not increase with the extender it decreased when connecting to the new network   after an hour on the phone the customer service rep tried to sell me a new netgear router  blaming my router for not extending the network    i have an apple airport extreme  which is still very good   i am so turned off by netgear   i will never buy from them again and am throwing this unit in the garbage   please do more research   i thought i did  and now am out the money      
88,4.0 ,                       i was traveling and hotel apartment i was in had an old router that was set up in the closet  i couldn t move it  and the wifi signal was horrible in the apartment  i have one of these bad boys at home and it works great  so figured i would buy another one  there was ethernet ports set up around the apartment  so i made this an access point to boost my  g signal  it worked like a charm  my wifi  g stopped dropping and i had consistent speeds throughout the apartment  no more lag  no more issues  only thing i don t like  is that it caps the speeds at    mbps on  g  i wish it was a bit more powerful since i have  gb speed at home and would have loved to have used this as a booster upstairs  which i still do  but more as an extender when i need it  this is now my traveling wifi extender so i can ensure i have coverage everywhere      
89,1.0 ,                       i had to give this unit a low rating because i never got to use it  i was replacing a repeater that stopped working after power hit  i could not get this unit to work with my netgear r    p  so i called the number on the box and a tech logged onto my system and he could not get the unit to recognize my router  then he told me it was because my system had been hacked and it would cost between        to         for him to fix it  and i think everybody knows how much it would have cost me if i had agreed  for him to fix it  i have been running nighthawk with bitdefender on my mac and my old repeater was running fine  i am    and retired and i do not like people telling me i have to pay to fix something that i believe is not broken  and if my system was hacked netgear  their rep  is telling me that i am paying for bitdefender and does not work      
90,5.0 ,                       works great  kinda tricky getting it to work  on installing very slow booting up so take your time  don t rush  wait for the indicator lights to turn green indicating connections before doing the next step  once up and running the extender is easy to connect to your devices in the usual way  and my devices work much faster downloading and uploading i have verizon fios and the wifi coverage is horrible in my home  the extender really extended the range of my wifi without having to pay rental fees from verizon for their extender and if you want you can really extend the range with an ethernet cable to a remote location in your home if you live in a palace or something      
91,1.0 ,                       with or without it  my netgear dual band primary router put out the same secondary speed to all smartphones and pc s throughout the two story single family home  so in short  the gizmo is useless and does nothing to improve speed  tech support is no help either   they simply state the obvious  this doo dah will not increase your download speed   hey  i never expected that  give me a break  i am not that of a novice  but if my hard wired primary clocks in at     mbps and my  g devices on the same floor weigh in at          i would expect this extender to prove useful on the lower floor  did not happen   with or without  the speed remained the same  so why would i spend thirty dollars      
92,5.0 ,                       i am an intermediate computer user  i am in graphic design  but have no training in it or computer science this thing works quite well with my dual channel  g router however  i tried everything under the sun to get it to link up to my router using the computer  the instructions were clear on what to do  i followed them  it was so frustrating that i nearly returned it  i never called tech support then i tried setting it up on my iphone  it was set up with minimal fuss in less than    minutes  it was easy actually  but  a big but here  if you are a novice with computers  routers  networks  etc  good luck with trying to get this set up  if you are intermediate to advanced  you will have no problem but i recommend setting it up with your smart phone this may be helpful to others  they don t explain the big picture  probably because they feel like if you are buying this router wifi signal extender  you are already computer saavy here is my interpretation  so maybe another dummy like me can understand    the device makes a new wifi to connect to  let me explain  say when you get on your laptop or smart phone at home where you have a router and wifi  it shows your router s default name as  e  u    or maybe you renamed your connection as  shackles   maybe you see your neighbor s network and he named his  imaretard  and your other neighbor s is  tardis   you know the routine  you pick your network  shackles   and you use the password printed on the router to log in your device  and it will be the one printed on the router unless you changed it yourself  it works that way to log in your smartphone  ipad  xbox  laptop  whatever it is you have that needs wifi    so what this litte box does  wifi extender  when you set it up near your router  is that is links to it but makes a new name  so if my router was called shackles  it makes what looks like a new router in your list of wifi networks  it defaults to using your router s name and adds  ext to it  so when i use my iphone and go to settings and hit wifi  i can connect to shackles or shackles ext  the latter acts like another router but it is in reality just the extender you are connecting to that is linked to the original router    so what does it all mean  well  say my router is in the den where i hang out and use my wifi devices  i can probably connect to shackles since the signal is strong in the same room  now say i have a detached garage in the back yard that has been converted into a workshop or maybe a game room with a pooltable where me and the guys hang out and have some beers and maybe play xbox  welp  i find that i can t get a good enough signal from my router in the den  xbox is lagging big time on my online multiplayer first person shooter games  so i plug in the extender in the garage  lo and behold i can connect to shackles ext with a very strong signal and everything works great with no lag or slow connectuon smart people may think i m an idiot for writing all this  i don t care  i just hope it could help someone like me who didn t understand how this damn thing worked out of the box      
93,2.0 ,                       i pay for   mbps   i have never gotten above    but it s always remained around         several xfinity techs have come by and i even bought a new  stronger  router to no avail then a tech said i needed an extender   my router is in straight site to devices so i didn t think that was the cause but i got it anyway   was very simple to connect   after which i tried my     and   mhz and not only was it slower  i noticed no real increase in strength  fair    i tested speed test after speed test w  different channels and locations and it s simply not an improvement unfortunately this did not solve my problem and i will be returning      
94,4.0 ,                       it took a little while to install     it wasn t taking at first  finally got the laptop to recognize it  i wanted it so i could use my laptop on my patio outside my back door  my house has aluminum siding and the router is upstairs in the front of the house so it could not get the signal before   it works  but i found that in the daytime there is slot of glare on the laptop screen from the daylight  so i can only use it in the evening or some angles of the shade   it does help with the signal in other parts of the house  thought at times when the signal is low   so  i will keep it  i have had it for a month or two  but haven t used in the back yard much due to the glare so it may be not long enough to give it a good review   i will revisited this review in the future     
95,5.0 ,                       speed is excellent  i get the same speed    mbps  through extender as i get when i m a few feet from the router range is great  too  i find my phone connected to the extender more often than the router  as it seems to have better range than the router setup has a hiccup because i use a content filtering router  clean router   i worked through that and now it is purring along didn t need to call support so i can t speak for that very pleased      
96,5.0 ,                       i live on a farm in the mountains and depend on wifi for phone service  i lose service and wifi walking out the front door  so after reading reviews on several devices  i settled on netgear because i was familiar with the name and the price was decent  the setup is easy  although it may not pertain to the model  a box pops up  you find the networks on your router and plug in the passwords  after it pairs  you can unplug it and plug it into the room where you want the extender  you need to locate the  ext  extension on your wifi choices and enter in your router password  then  when you go into the area where the extender is  connect to the ext wifi you set up  i synced my phone and walked out the door   no drop and full bars  i walked about fifty feet down a hill and i stayed with full or nearly full bars and my wifi phone coverage never dropped  i wish i d bought this a year ago  if anything changes  i ll update the review but as of now  it s great and gives me coverage where i need it      
97,4.0 ,                       we re using this as a remote access point rather than a range extender  and it has worked very well   the moca in our tivo mini went bad  minis don t do wifi   and we didn t have a reasonable way to run ethernet to its  parent  tivo  so we put the netgear ex     in to act as a remote access point   we turned off the  bridge  radio because a range extender was not needed  but the ex     was a better value w better reviews than ap only solutions we were considering   very happy with it   easy to set up  and the mini  which technically requires a wired connection but can t tell the difference because of the ex     s high bandwidth   low latency  works with it without a hiccup      
98,5.0 ,                       well made and works great when plugged into outlet closer to area or devices where signal strength is too weak for devices to operate as required  the original signal strength is extended to the same strength as original location  i did have an issue with initial setup and received great technical assistance by the company with know how and patience to work me through the problem which was caused by my networking with dual ethernet and wifi running at same time but they helped me through it pleasantly      
99,5.0 ,                       i now have wifi in areas of the house that i didn t before   due to using wep security i did have to set it up and use different wifi network for     and     and connect to them on each device that i wanted to use it on   kind of a pain  but i understand why   if you are not using wep then it shouldn t be a problem and seems pretty simple   might need a little technical knowledge to set it up using wep   instructions aren t super clear all and all i m happy with the purchase and might even add another to add more coverage      
100,5.0 ,                       this netgear wifi range extender is so simple to set up  i needed it for wifi and did not want to hard wire it  i attached the cable to my modem and powered it up  i checked to be sure my computer network could see the device  went to the provided webpage  entered my security information  powered it down  removed the cable  took it to another location in the house and plugged it in  my laptops recognized the network extender so i entered my password  which you provide   and it instantly connected  i had problems with intermittent disconnections prior to installing the extender  no such problems now  i have a   story home now and wifi is accessible wherever we are in the home   one additional note  windows    would not bring up the webpage they provide for the security information so i used a different browser which you may also need to do      
101,1.0 ,                       i just bought this because we have a netgear router   we were expecting that it will be easy to install   however  when my husband try to install it  it turned off my internet connection entirely  including our computer and laptop   we have smarttv with at t  all of our televisions got turned off and needed to be re programmed   even after reprogramming our televisions  our internet are still not connected   i am so disappointed      
102,1.0 ,                       i installed this multiple places through my house and none of the areas made a difference  i get a better signal without the range extender  in my bedroom  i was averaging   mbps and after installing the range extender in my room  the living room thats down the hall and in the hall  i got   mbps  i even installed it in my office right next to the modem and got  mbps tops  this extender is awful      
103,4.0 ,                       this is the first wifi extender that i have ever purchased  set up was a breeze and could not ask for anything easier from a plug and play scenario  i did not use the wps setup and opted to use the browser app set up  purchased this to extend my wifi to a detached garage  wifi in the house was strong everywhere before purchasing  and we had a weak yet usable signal right outside our back door on the porch  once setup i placed it in an outlet located on an exterior wall on our second floor  once i stepped out the back door of the house the signal was already weak  i am guessing this is caused by some extreme interference from the walls of our house  we have a     yr old house with vinyl siding over shaker  and also plaster and lathe walls inside with which i am positive have many years of lead paint  some of the walls are also drywall over the plaster lathe  anyway  once i placed this in the garage it had no issue grabbing the very weak signal from the house and getting wifi  so far it has performed well with only dropping the wifi signal a few times  for the price it is a very solid buy      
104,5.0 ,                       got this to be able to do workouts in the garage   its currently plugged into the exterior laundry room and i workout on the other side of the wall   gets great reception  however if you plan on using this for multiple products  i would recommend something a bit stronger   for example  i was able to facebook live or zoom and stream music on my phone with no issues   added a ring camera no issues  but when i tried to zoom and share an online video at the same time  so we can all do the same workout video together  there is just not enough bandwidth   but i have to say  for the price point  it does a good job      
105,4.0 ,                       i use the ethernet over power line without the wifi of this brand  recently used the slower wifi model with good results  but  this model and the more expensive faster model give much more speed over  ghz  noticed this model is much thicker  more robust signal strength  and actually give me over     mps over   ghz from my     mps down cable internet  so  i m sold on the better model which at this writing is only a few more dollars  i have set this up as an access point  and about to try this device as a connected access point  try this it will surprise you at the speed of the better unit      
106,3.0 ,                       so far so good  i tried naming the ssids the same and it confused some of my devices  worked out better for me with a different name with the  ext on the end of the ssid   setup was easy and resetting it and starting over was easy too edit  so the ssid names threw me off because i was having some initial performance issues and renaming them helped me know what my devices connected to the  primary ap or the extender    after a little more research i realized that extenders act as repeaters and you cannot change the channel in use by the extender   so if your primary ap is on channel    the extender will be as well  and because of that channel overlap you get interference when your device can see both the ap and extender at the same time   this would work best if you have a large property and want to place this on the edge of your existing coverage to send it way out into your yard   really the best way to go is to buy a second ap and run a cable to it from your main access point router switch cable modem  whatever you have  program the same ssids but put them on different channels   for    g  remember you should only use channels         nothing in between   for  g keep the channel width at   mhz and if you are on     use something like     or or     instead for your second ap      
107,3.0 ,                       wasn t that easy to install for some reason and coverage not that great and i install fios for a living  but i have spectrum  no choice  and use their router so that s part of the problem   the other is i live in a nyc apartment building  so get the strongest one      
108,1.0 ,                       i had big plans for this baby  i had six devices  each  one at a time  that i needed it for  it was nonfunctional for all but one of them  either does not connect or saaaays it s connected  but the connection is useless and i cant go anywhere or do anything with it  the one device that worked  though  worked just fine  so it s up to you  if you re willing to take a gamble  and can get it for    or less  it s definitely a better investment  as a gamble  than    worth of lottery tickets      
109,1.0 ,                       reading consumer reports dismal review of this device reminds me of how disappointed i am with this purchase  here are the results of my test of download and upload speeds directly from my netgear nighthawk router and then from this ex      range extender             mbps via extender               mbps direct to routeri was wondering why my laptop and iphone started experiencing problems   and then realized both were automatically latching on to the extender  unplugged the extender and everything is working as it should given how well the netgear router works  i decided to buy their extender  big mistake      
110,3.0 ,                       all in all the unit does what it should   install was easy enough and the wifi extender does work well on both     and     ghz      but it lacks range   i am using it in a      sq foot brick ranch dwelling   the router is install in the front room and the extender in the back room of the house   the extender does pick up the signal from the router with one bar  my expectation based on the the product description was that i would get about a      sq feet out side   this till is where the extender fell short of expectations   when connected on a device in an out builder just a few feet from the house i was only able to get one bar which made for an unstable connection   i have moved the extender around but it still falls short of expectations   to close i would recommend the device but you need to look at how the extender will be used  it may not have the power you need      
111,1.0 ,                       i spent over   hrs trying to set this up  there is no  setup new device  button  call customer service  but the girl from some foreign country couldn t help me  she  technical service call  again foreign  he was hard to understand  he wanted access to my laptop  i refused  he told me to hire a professional to set it up  i asked for him to just tell me where on his website do you find the  setup new device  button is found  he hung up on me  i bought two extenders and can t use either    i m well over         in the hole now  i don t like being hung up on  especially when you ask a straight forward question that obviously  he couldn t answer  i m just going to file a complaint with the bbb  i can t say if they work well  because i can t set them up  it shouldn t be this hard      
112,1.0 ,                       i wasted days on this product  i got it toconnect  good signal  butttt it would dropoff a day later  it did not recognize thepassword  magically it would  reconnect thenext day  i thought it was something i was doing  disconnected all devices  still problems  gave up after   weeks  i thought it was defective and wanted to give it another try but it would take a month to replace so i bought a linksys  connected in   minutes and no problems  to think i wasted my time with the netgear for   weeks      
113,1.0 ,                       my wifi extender was delivered yesterday  i spent   days trying to connect this to my xbt   comcast xfinity router modem  with no success  i tried connecting with wps and using the mywifiext com website mentioned in the quick start manual and nothing worked  after registering the device  i looked online for a customer support phone number to see if a specialist could help  fyi   before i was provided with a support phone number  i had to enter my personal info several times before the website finally accepted it and provided me with a case number and phone number for home support  i called the phone number and was greeted by a  gate keeper  she asked for personal info from me again and had me on hold forever while she connected me to a  specialist   when the specialist answered  he also asked me for personal info and my case number and call back phone number  i explained my problem and he told me to use a pen or paper clip to press and hold the factory reset button for    seconds  while doing that  it sounded like he was snoring in my ear lol  i asked  what is that noise   because i refused to believe that he had fallen asleep while speaking with me  then  he said  hello  sir  twice  and then mysteriously  the call was disconnected  keep in mind  he asked me for my number and said if we were disconnected  he would call me back within    seconds  these were his exact words  but  of course  i did not receive a callback so  now i have this useless wifi extender from net gear that just will not connect  which will be going back to amazon asap for a refund  while i understand that these companies outsource their customer service to india because it s much cheaper than hiring usa personnel  this experience was absolutely ridiculous and a complete waste of my time  after the extended wait times to reach someone to assist me and getting hung up on  i refuse to call back to try to resolve this  i ll do my research on another company and try again when they use the term  buyer beware   this is exactly what they are referring to  if you need phone support to set up this device   you will not get it i tried to submit this review with   stars  but amazon would not allow it  so i had to choose   star  which was not deserved  be careful  guys  i just thought it was really strange that after entering all of my personal info into their website to obtain a case number and support contact number  that i was asked for that same info again  seems suspicious  especially  when i m clearly speaking with people from india  which is evident by their extremely thick accents      
114,5.0 ,                       i was adding the netgear extender to an apple airport network  so wps was not an option  the airport extreme base station does not have a wps button  however  the install via web browser instructions worked  and i was able to set up the  gh and  gh extended networks with no problems i connect my macbook pro to the network with an ethernet cable from the extender  since there is a known problem with usb connected peripherals causing interference with wifi and bluetooth with the model i have   thanks  apple   download speed tests with the extender ran as high as   mbps out of a theoretical     far higher than i d ever seen when i used an airport express so why my   star quibble on easy to install  somehow in the process  our two wifi connected canon printers got lost  i m not really network knowledgeable  and it s entirely possible that it was something i did  i think it was something to do with the printers being on one network branch and the computers on another  but i haven t been able to figure out how to see where the printers are on the network  so i m not sure   as i said  not network knowledgeable  what i did was start over  deleted the printers in system preferences  set up the extended network again  added the printers so far  so good           
115,3.0 ,                       the wi fi extender works fine for me  i don t live in a huge house but the router is in the far room from my roku stick and the roku was getting a low signal  i set up the extender  which was as easy as pressing a button on the extender and a button on my router to pair them  and then i moved the extender in my bedroom  which is on the other end of the house  and now my roku stick is getting a good signal  that proves that it s working  wi fi speeds are also similar when i m connected to the extender  my home internet is   mbps down and the extender gets anywhere between    and    down  depending on which band i m connected to  because this is a dual band wi fi extender  i wouldn t take a second to recommend this extender to anyone  it works update  here lately it s been losing connection to the router a lot  it worked fine for a long time but the last month i ve had issues with it  lowering my rating to   stars      
116,3.0 ,                       this came with another persons info still installed on it  it took me an hour or so to figure it out and still i have just one working wifi on it and it s my  g so i m not getting much extra range i suppose i should just call and get it help but i have already wasted a few hours of time and     of my money  i can t even return it this might be a good product but the seller i got it from never even bothered to reset it oh also it came with zero instructions  it was just in a bag in a box with it looked like it was ordered from wish com the way it came      
117,5.0 ,                       i want to put a computer in a room that gets a poor signal   the extender was purchased to address this weak zone without having to pull wire i have a  netgear      router  about     years old  rated for ac    for     and   ghz   this extender matched those specs from the same company so i expected it to be easy to install  and it was we have a    story wood frame house   the router is in the basement and the location for the new computer is on the third floor on the opposite side of the house   internet service to the house is from optimim at     mbps testing was done with a new lg  x thinq phone   for comparison  next to the router my new lg phone  using the verizon speed test website i am getting about     to     mbps on   ghz down and    to    up       ghz running about    down and    up at the weak zone  no extender  i was getting   ghz  about    to    down and      up       running about      down and     up i tested various midpoints for the extender at the best intermediate location  without extender    to     mbps up and    to    download speed on   ghz after installing the extender  testing in the weak zone  i am getting about    to    up on   ghz and    to    down at the worst spot   on     i am getting    to    up and about    to    down the numbers can vary quite a bit from test run to test run with latency showing    to    ms from test to test  so the numbers are typical for a set of tests   and the way i hold the phone can influence the results i am very satisfied with the results and will be using the extender to attach the computer on the third floor   it will be used for general purpose internet  email  virtual meetings and occasional youtube if this were a gaming machine or running heavy media work i would pull wire to this location      
118,2.0 ,                       we bought this device as the wifi signal strength in a bedroom was insufficient for the roku remote to function   moving the rremote      ft closer established functionality so it was close  a range extender should have been the answer   we were surprised to find it was not simple to set up  method one sounds simple  just press the wps button on the extender  then on the router   our comcast router has no wps button  so on to method     through a browser except we cant access a browser on the roku   also it requires you go go through a set up procedure on each and every device you want to connect to wifi through the extender   the instructions are not written in any form of english i m familiar with   if your an it pro  you might be able to make it work for you   after    minutes  everyone in the family voted to send it back   the frustration just wasnt worth it   ps nowhere in the instruction manual was any info on how to contact customer service    yeah  we could have probably found it online  but noone was paying us for the time we were already wasting      
119,3.0 ,                       i had a netgear unit for years  worked great   so when it died i bought another   it did not work   neither did cust svc   kept walking thru the script  even though i was familiar with the product and the trouble shooting   called back the next day  got a much better rep who finally admitted the new one just did not work   i just returned it and bought an att unit   customer service counts        
120,5.0 ,                       i live in the county so the cell service sucks and the only wifi is satellite  the router for it has very limited range  you can sit out side the house     feet away from the router  with one wood wall in the way and only get two bars of wifi  with the wifi extender i now have wifi across my whole       acres it was very easy to set up and use the satellite router only outputs  g  but sense the netgear ac    does both  g and  g i can use it withe every device i have i wish i would have had the a long time ago  i have even told my neighbors about it  i hope it last longer then some of the other reviews      
121,2.0 ,                       there were mixed reviews on this  but i still decided to go with it  as it is from netgear  it was not too bad to install  but initial directions are a bit off  other reviews advised on how to install  after installation  i ran various tests  but it was also when the device was by the router  after moving it to the location i wasn t to get covered  i rechecked it  and it was worse than my initial connection  and i use a couple different bandwidth tests   i moved the device back to about    feet away from the router and set it up there  i only received a little more speed from that point      
122,5.0 ,                       crisp signal so pleased it worked so well  its    ft from my router  its actually better than expected  i review all my purchases on amazon and dutiful read alot of the reviews before purchase  you can purchase w confidence  its been on now for    days and its very very helpful in my work  pleased w this purchase it was less expensive than others i viewed and small and compact in appearance      
123,5.0 ,                       i haven t a review in a long time but wanted to drop for this bad internet in my house  five users means five devices at any given time  sometimes more  first  i upgraded my router  that worked well for a while  but over the last couple of weeks the wifi signal in my family room has dropped  don t know why  maybe it s the christmas tree  i dunno  but it crapped big time  router placement isn t ideal  but it s where it has to be  my roku started buffering or degrading the picture and i was using my cell s hot spot to use my laptop   after doing the requisite reading of reviews  i settled on this extender  i ve only had it a day  but wow  what a noticeable difference setup  cake  my router has wps so it was literally clicking a button on the extender and a button on my router  my only misstep in the whole process was entering my password wrong on my laptop  could not have been easier signal  got a great signal now  i spent several hours streaming hulu on my roku  hulu is the worst offender when my signal is low and it streamed like a pro today  laptop is actually loading pages again and letting me do things like write this review i ll admit this review is only after a day of use  but it s like night day      
124,3.0 ,                       i was expecting much better performance compared to my old n     it s reach and speed is almost identical  it s price is not  i would like to note that i do not have the same issues as i do with my n     constant drops and having to reset and deal with the horrible set up  literally weeks wasted hunched over by my router trying to constantly reconfigure the n    for use  all in all stability increased  range and connection speeds were blatantly exaggerated  was an okay purchase  whatever happened to getting good range on wifi  seems like everything sold is single room range      
125,4.0 ,                       there are probably betters ones out there but more expensive for sure   this made my roku wifi go from a single bar of wifi signal to   out of     if i put it closer  i could even get another bar  but it wasn t practical to get it closer set up was a cinch with the wps button   led indicator lights let me know if i was too far from the device or the router     you should know this is not a mesh system   it creates a  sub network  so you should use this on something that is permanently within the new sub network like a roku  wireless dvd player or something like that   if you move a device in an out of the network like your cell phone  you have to manually select the new network each time  unless you totally lose the signal of the previous network   then it will find the strongest one   probably your new sub network   bottom line   it performs fine for what i need for the price i paid      
126,5.0 ,                       my pole barn is     from my house and at least        from my wifi modem  in the summer with my doors up i have a decent wifi connection in the barn  however in the winter with the doors closed there is absolutely zero signal  i live in a verizon dead zone out in the country so i rely on my wifi for phone calls which works great except when i m in my wood shop in my pole barn   i ordered this hoping it would extend my network to my shop and i am really happy to say it works great  i plugged this in near a window facing my house and within   mins i had excellent wifi throughout my pole barn  i can now make wifi phone calls in my pole barn which was a absolutely impossible before      
127,4.0 ,                       to start  i have awful internet  frontier    it s my only option  so any improvement is a big improvement for me  this extender has allowed me to stream netflix  and occasionally hbo  and i can normally play online video games i won t give five stars because it s incredibly annoying having to log into netgear on the regular when my internet disconnects from a device in order to  set up  when i ve already done it  updates are a bit annoying  presently arguing with one now  overall  i d recommend  it makes the awful company that is frontier slightly more tolerable      
128,1.0 ,                       second time i have bought netgear product which is supposed to come with    days tech support  on first occasion  my netgear router didn t work   tech spent nearly   hours trying to remedy problem  during the entire process  he was pointing out assorted failures that i never experienced with linksys  when this extender unit didn t work  the tech tried talking me into a      dollar support plan so he can set up hardware and software firewalls  that was for tech support only  not the hw or sw  problem  i already have a fully functioning firewall that he didn t  see despite having remote access to my computer  the amazon tech immediately recognized the issue as a bad extender and sent a call tag  i m done with netgear      
129,5.0 ,                       we ve had for   weeks now and so far so good   we have a very long house  with a media room upstairs on one side of the house  opposite side from our wifi router    we were having difficulties streaming on the tv because the wifi reception was spotty being on the end of the wifi range   after reading through the reviews  i purchased this product   at first i tried just plugging it in and setting up wirelessly by pushing the wps buttons  but it wouldn t connect   i finally just opened my laptop to do it through the ip and it was done in   minutes  should have just done this first    we used extender mode  and plugged it in downstairs on the other side of the house from our current router   we still don t get a perfect signal upstairs  but it s at least one  bar  higher and we have less  buffering  issues also  i tested the speed before and after connecting this extender  and did not lose any  surprisingly   i went up to the media room to have a controlled area  and sat in the same spot through both tests   my regular wifi was running about    mbps  and i switched to the extender and got about    mbps   i just ran it now  however  while i m sitting next to my wifi router  away from the extender  and i m getting      mbps on my regular wifi  and about    mbps on the extender      
130,5.0 ,                       grear product  we have xfinity   comcast    we have a garage we turned into a studio apartment   for some reason our wifi from our house would not get signal in our studio garage  we called comcast   they said we needed to purchase their wifi booster     well their wifi booster cost over         we really didn t feel like paying      for that so we did a little research and found this wifi range booster   it works  we now have great wifi signal in our garage   studio and it was super easy to set up and install  i highly recommend       
131,1.0 ,                       i was pumped waiting for this to be delivered  i have spectrums    mbps down  a couple rooms away from the router wifi is a bit slower  but speeds always test in the low mid   s  so i thought this would get one of these to boost that signal as much as possible on the other side of my small house setup went fine  but i was infuriated when my speed tests never broke     down when connected to this piece of garbage  being a troubleshooter  i tried multiple devices  wirelessly and with ethernet  this thing only slowed my speed to a crawl this thing does not support up to    mbps as advertised  sitting in the same spot  i disconnected from the extender and connected back straight to my router  and my speed test went back up to around    mbps down this thing is a piece of garbage and i will be returning asafp      
132,2.0 ,                       instructions say to download app  did that  app did not support the product  tried several different links per instructions  no progress  watched a youtube video by a customer and go it to work  low or no signal  wasted   hours dealing with install  returned it      
133,4.0 ,                       i have this range extender for   day and i love it so far  my isp router is in the front of my home so the wifi signal gets weak in the middle and drops to the back  so this has boosted the signal tremendously  doing my research and learned about dual band routers and so i was contemplating purchasing the netgear n    which is cheaper but single band  but this model has dual bands so even though it was slightly more expensive i bought it  setup was ridiculously easy  i sent it to a friend who brought it for me so i did not get the documentation but i simply plugged my ethernet cable into the device and the setup steps through the browser was very easy  i have only one issue with the device which is why i gave it   stars  after plugging it in for   hour i realized the device gets really warm hot  i hope this is normal  but i dont think it should be so warm  thinking about it as i type this  the power supply and the wifi electronics are all in one small package plugged into the outlet  so maybe that s the reason why its so warm  but it does make me wonder if i can keep this plugged in       i guess time will tell update july         two weeks ago this device stopped working just like that  i am extremely dissappointed to say the least  when i plug it in  its dead dead dead  i want to send this back and get back my money      
134,5.0 ,                       i bought this booster not knowing if i was wasting my money or not  i have a cabin that had comcast wireless internet and cable tv  everything worked great until i decided to upgrade to  xfinity  i was told by the technician that my wireless signal would not be as strong after upgrading  i didn t understand the reasoning and i hoped he was wrong  turned out he wasn t wrong  the wireless unit was placed in the same place as my older unit which was behind my living room tv  all the wifi devices worked great near the front of the house in and near the living room  after he left i brought my ipad to the rear of the house furthest away from the wifi unit  i had absolutely no reception  a friend told me about wifi boosters  i bought this one  easily hooked it up in the guest room located near the middle of the cabin and now i get excellent wifi reception throughout the entire cabin and outside  this is definitely worth the money     
135,1.0 ,                       had issues installing it  contacted tech support and was told that without a computer i could not install it  i mentioned that    i do not own a computer or laptop    nowhere in the description or manual mentions the need for a computer or laptop  in fact  manual clearly has instructions for ios devices as well as android devices   at that point  tech support simply ignored me  waste of time  sending it back      
136,1.0 ,                       i tried for   hours to set this up and never came close  i got on the phone to tech support  in the philippines  and spent an hour and a quarter before it was finally resolved  i recommend strongly against buying this product because of the severe difficulty installing this product   what a frickin  nightmare   then i get up this morning and email  excel   other things are screwed up  thx netgear        
137,5.0 ,                       ok  so i originally bought this for myself to expand the wifi coverage in my house  because i spend a lot of time in the garage and it s far away from my router  but last year i visited my grandparents who live in a tiny texas town  and my phone was no signal from sprint  no phone no internet  nothing  i asked around and seems only people with at t phones  were ever able to get any kind of service  and that was extremely hit or miss  but  my grandparents do have internet through their cable tv service provider  my problem was  i was  and do  do a lot of work for them out in the barn that is about     yards from their house  so my phone wasn t picking up the router that was inside their house  so i drove an hour home  snagged this thing out of my house  drove back  and plugged this into an outlet inside an old greenhouse shed my grandmother keeps plants inside during the winter  it was the perfect halfway mark  now i can be inside this massive metal barn  and get fantastic internet signal inside this extender has been inside that green house now for almost   years  it still works       i run diagnostics on it with my app about every other month  just to make sure it s not needing any kind of update or needs to be reset  i am very pleased with this little thing  and highly recommend it to anyone that needs to bring the internet out to the house and out to the barn so you can look for parts or videos on how to fix something  or stream music out in the barn while you weld or wrench on your next project  makes it not so lonely in there        
138,5.0 ,                       like other commentators   set up was easy  it takes a few seconds  so be patient with both turn on and initial link set up  had a laptop that was too slow due to connect speed  and not that far away  probably just some  metal  wall issue   connected the ac    and plugged into an outlet not far from the laptop  all  bars   still the factor is ac    connection to the  originating router  speed was not measured quantitatively  but download of a large zip fill was  fast   playing youtube hd videos was seamless  no dropouts or drop in resolution  performance went from unacceptable to very acceptable      
139,5.0 ,                       i bought this for testing really   i live  out there  and we were testing how to connect devices with the iphone hotspot   i honestly gave up on this for a while but needed to connect a desktop   in the end i think  at least in this case  walking through the setup and leaving the password blank made the difference   now it just works   next is to try to connect a wireless router to this network for additional ports   if that doesn t work i ll try a hub      
140,5.0 ,                       our wifi router is downstairs and my office is upstairs   the neighbor s house is closer to my office  through a window  than the downstairs router   tried all kinds of ways of preventing my neighbors signal from interfering with my wifi found a plug upstairs  on a line between the router and my computer  set it up  easy   and the problem is disappeared   i have been using it for months without any problem or need for rebooting this device   i recomment it      
141,3.0 ,                       pretty simple to install just plug it in near your router for the initial setup  afterwards move it to the location you want to extend  there also a signal indicator for placement  update          after a few weeks of use i noticed the unit getting bad reception so i moved it closer to the router now it seems to disconnect very frequently even though it s closer  about    ft away from router with one wall in between      
142,3.0 ,                       when you get a connection  it s great and works well   getting the proper connection is the problem   on certain walls in my house  it failed  even when the extender was on the same floor as the wifi   had to search for a wall where the extender would work   finally found one and it now works well   also found that one could not have two extenders in the same house   they seem to argue with one another   on the whole  it is ok  but does not work nearly as well as one that i purchased several months ago for a condo i have in metro dc      
143,3.0 ,                       it dose work and if your wanting to get better wi fi in the one corner of the house where there is a week signal  than this dose the job  however don t expect amazing  i was trying to extend to a guest house    from the outside of my house and about     from the router and got ok results  service is     meg down and in the guest house i get    down on  g band and    meg down on the  g band both are usable and dose work  just not what i was hopeing for  i got a netgear powerline and that is what i would recommend  i placed the powerline adapter under my carport and get    meg   all over the back yard and including the guest house  bottom line i would sound alittle more and get the powerline version      
144,1.0 ,                       there are two methods of linking this thing to your router   i decided to use the web connection which immediately failed  but suddenly i was on a chat with someone who quickly connected me to  tech support  via my telephone   phone rang in seconds and i was cordially greeted by a man with a  you guessed it   se asian accent   my mistake      i allowed him to take control of my computer  and immediately he found  many  foreign intrusions   he volunteered to  fix  them if  my mistake     i gave him a few minutes to do that   god knows what he was extracting from my computer while he proceeded to tell me horror stories about the perils of not having a firewall  and he then proceeded to enumerate the virtues of the  firewall  he was prepared to install immediately   he asked for my address   phone number  he already had that   then displayed the plan options and prices    or   years       to       and asked for my credit card number oh  geez   at that point it  finally  dawned on my simple brain that i was potentially very vulnerable  i began quickly to disengage  and cut off power to the computer the whole experience left me feeling foolish and shaken  and i m returning the device because i m not sure i m secure with this thing inside my lan now that it connects to my router without needing a password   i want this thing out of my house      
145,5.0 ,                       this wifi range extender was exactly what we needed  easy to install following the instructions included in the box  and even easier if your router has wps capability  our u verse one does   plugged it in and had it completely ready to go in less than    minutes  once i located it in the area where our wifi had been dropping  other side of the house on the top floor   i measured the internet speed on the new extended wifi network and it was  x what we had been getting from our standard router  great performance note  by default  this extender creates a new network with    gext  at the end of your main home network  and    gext  if you decide to utilize the dual band feature  and uses the same password as your home network  but you can create an account online and change all of these settings  you can also reduce the wifi power output from the extender                 or the default       and as a result  reduce the range if you don t need it to cover a large area   very handy option to save power      
146,1.0 ,                       i spent a couple few hours with my friend and i trying to installed and get this unit to work   wasted our time   the unit provide only about    mbps download speed only from my house     mbps capable xfinity router   tried both  g and  g and various location in the house  all with the same slow result   look up phone number for netgear on the internet only to connect to  rd party scammer from india  sorry it is typical but sad    finally this morning i went online and chat with amazon agents who did not know what to do and connect to netgear technical support   after a long time  here is the result   he told me that this ex     is only good for speed up to    mbps and anything higher  i should use the model           why was this information not on the product description    wasted our time and their time   in fact the product description on amazon is very confusing and miss leading   read below netgear wifi range extender ex       coverage up to      sq ft  and    devices with ac    dual wireless signal booster   repeaterby netgearextended wireless coverage  adds wifi range coverage up to      square feet  and connects up to    devices such as laptops  smartphones  speakers  ip cameras  tablets  iot devices  and moreac    wifi speed  provides up to    mbps performance using dual band and patented fastlane technologyuniversal compatibility  works with any wireless router  gateway  or cable modem with wifi  the product may not be compatible with routers or gateways with firmware that has been altered  is based on open source programs  or is non standard or outdatedwired ethernet port  simply plug in game consoles  streaming players  or other nearby wired devices using the one       m port for maximum speedsafe   secure  supports wep and wpa wpa  wireless security protocolssimple to setup  press the wps button to connect to your router  use the netgear wifi analyzer app for optimal location no idea where this model  ac    wifi speed  provides up to    mbps performance using dual band and patented fastlane technology   come from   this is confusing and the netgear agent told me that i should have contacted technical support to find out more about this unit from netgear before i buy it from amazon   is this bs or not and how many of us with do that   apparently netgear sold many of these  slow units to home with slow internet speed   but there are many customers complained about this reduction in speed with this unit   yet amazon or netgear do not respond and make correction or correct the omission that this unit is for    mbps only   after almost one hour  finally i gave up and decided to return this   amazon agent was soooo kind to give me fund refund   wow   i think i may get    coupon for our hours of work   netgear management  fix the problem and it is also amazon s responsibility too       
147,5.0 ,                       product was easy to install  installation was done by my     years old son who is fascinated with technology  we first placed the extender in his room but sign sl was poor  so we lluggednit in a wall socket in tge dining room just outside his bedroom door and in close proximity to the router and it works like a charm  he had a challenge getting good internet connectivity in his bedroom as such he would have to step out into the adjoining dining to pick up signal  since the installation  internet connectivity has been absolutely great in his room and in the nughts when signals are normally lower he still has good signal above average in his room  no more lagging of fb videos  zoom classes etc      
148,4.0 ,                       it took me a little while to get this set up with our router  now that everything is working  the wi fi signal is very strong throughout our entire house  we don t seem to have any trouble with connection  we have   laptops    phones  amazon fire  a ps   and a ps  connected to this device getting this device connected to a router was the only difficult part  i m kind of tech savvy so this wasn t too tough for me  however  i could see how this would be tough for someone who doesn t know much about setting up tech equipment  the instructions were good  so if you follow those you shouldn t have any trouble  we are really happy with the boost of our wi fi signal  this was a good purchase      
149,5.0 ,                       these work  they don t work great but they work  i haven t found any of these extenders or boosters to work all that great so these will do as well as any  i think it has to do with fcc regulations that make everything work just mediocre  i have a large property and i had to daisy chain some of these for them to do what i needed  i wish they had made the signal stronger and the data stream is limited for some reason   i have no idea why it is slow compared to the original wifi signal     
150,2.0 ,                       i m pretty good with electronics and computers  i m a programmer  i ve owned and used this for   months now  i have used this extender off of a netgear r     router  and the initial setup using wps works fine  it finds my network  sets up new ssids for the     and   ghz bands  and works fine  for a couple months then suddenly it stops working  the lights say it s on  you can see the ssid listed  but if you connect to it  i ve tested with phones  tablets  and laptops  it will say   no internet connection   even though the router led is green i ve had to factory reset it to get it back up and running the firmware is up to date  my router settings don t change  i don t move it  it just stops working  i don t have time to fuss with it over and over again  i have some smart home devices that don t automatically switch to the other ssids in the house  since this still reads as available  so they stop working  it s too much hassle to keep it running  so i m pulling it out of use at my house      
151,5.0 ,                       absolutely worth the    don t let the reasonable price fool you into thinking this doesn t live up  this was worth every penny and more setup was super easy if you follow the instructions  if you re not a tech savvy person be sure to follow directions and be patient for the lights to turn green  meaning only a minute or so and it will work  if after a minute push the on off button as it states and start again  i am fortunate to have a spot on outlet upstairs where i plugged this in after setup that is directly above my downstairs router  my entire upstairs is now covered and the connectivity issues we had are gone  important for me when having to go through various networks while working from home  to give you a better idea of size  my home is      sqft  internet providers router is in the central point of my main level and i plugged this product upstairs right above the router  i could not connect my work laptop at all prior  but with this item i can now choose to work remotely anywhere in my home  we are now able to stream on a tv  have another tv on    laptops running  wifi printer  and an xbox and playstation all going at the same time without delays or disconnections  added bonus was finding out that the product even boosted the garage with a stronger connection than we were getting from the main router which is closer to the garage  i highly recommend this item      
152,5.0 ,                       bought   extenders   netgear has a very good reputation   our house is long  brick ranch so signal from router drops at both ends of the house   of course the den and the master bedroom are at opposite ends of the house   used an extender in each of those rooms   fairly easy to setup  but could be confusing to some   good good signal strength for amazon fire stick  laptops  tablets  and cell phones   to get best signal strength you may need to plug them into an extension cord so that you can alter placement   only con is they tend to get a little warm   we would purchase more if needed      
153,1.0 ,                       i tried a similar product  wifi extender  few years back and it was lowering the internet speed tremendously then after few years passed i figured that the technology may have gotten better  but i was wrong  item arrived and being an electronic engineer  i measured the speed   transmission loss at  g  fast internet  speed  internet speed was cut down in half from    mb s to     mb s and that was measured when i was latterly next to the wifi router then when i moved the extender to   ft away from my router  i checked the signal and i had     loss so technology is not there yet  i will try again in few year  but for now i returned it and in my opinion it is a waste of money      
154,2.0 ,                       i knew when buying this that i have never had good experience with netgear products  but it seemed simple enough for what i needed please be aware when buying this that you will not get    mbps connections  the extender is capable of receiving a     mbps connection from your router  but will not broadcast at that speed  i have gb internet in my home but my gateway from xfinity cannot reach the other end of the house from where the gateway is located  i wanted to use this to extend our signal to our main bedroom to use with a ps  for netflix and the like  i put the extender in a central location  i actually tried every outlet in the central area of our home  and found the outlet with the best connection to our gateway  as well as a good connection to the device  the output from the extender was   mbps  while this is plenty to stream video  ps  s tend to either throttle download speeds or their hardware is not capable enough to receive high speeds over wifi  i end up getting  mbps to the playstation  i ran a speedtest from my phone in the exact location of the playstation and over wifi to my android i was getting about    mbps i attempted to use the fastlane technology built in to the extender with no noticeable difference at all  the idea behind this is strong  where the extender receives on one band but broadcasts on another  i just dont think the extender has the processing power to faithfully reproduce a good high speed signal  since it s processor is pulling double duty on receiving and transmitting the product actually provided a wifi signal that devices could connect to  but the speeds were atrocious  if you have high speed internet and only need to extend your range for basic web surfing and email then you should be fine  i would not rely on this device for any sort of streaming or gaming though lastly  don t expect anything from netgear tech support after    days  you will have to pay for it      
155,4.0 ,                       i thought i would use this extender to distribute both     and   ghz bands from my wifi router  an asus rt acrh    using  basic  mode   the router is at one edge of the apartment and has trouble getting to the other end   the     ghz worked easily  but i could not get   ghz to work   there may be some extra router configuration needed so i decided to use the  fastlane  option  set up so that the extender communicates to the router at   ghz  and communicates to my devices at     ghz   this works reliably and  probably  much faster than repeating     ghz  in band    the   ghz bit rate is more than double the     rate   result  very strong coverage at     ghz over my      sq ft area      
156,5.0 ,                       i live in a household where the home s router is installed in one end of the home  and my room is situated in the area farthest and opposite of it  i can get internet access to things at an okay speed  but i noticed that trying to do anything involving online voice chatting  streaming  or multiplayer gaming related would be a bit slower than it should  especially on a computer that is less than a year old and is specifically meant to handle that stuff  in the beginning  it was fine since only a few online devices were connected to the wi fi at a time  so any hiccups were few and temporary  this was before the family decided to invest in a few streaming devices  roku  smart tv  ect   once those were set up and in use  everything i did either buffered or slowed to a crawl  this was especially aggravating since that made voice chatting impossible due to how robotic i would sound to friends i routinely chat with  and it was becoming a literal headache trying to figure out what was causing it i received this earlier today  and within    minutes of setting it i could  feel  the immediate improvement the moment i plugged it in an area near where my room is  every stress induced ache i was dealing with in the past vanished the moment i saw how fast i was opening a web page or opening up a youtube video  i even managed to have a lengthy voice chat with some discord friends for a good couple of hours since the setup was done  something i could not have had had i not bought this i will update this review in the next couple of months if there are any changes in how this extender functions  but just from a first time experience  absolutely worth it      
157,3.0 ,                       these do work and help relay wifi signals  even in insulated buildings however there is a high failure rate   any units do die prematurely and you need to create an account and give a lot of personal info just to set it up which is pointless they dont relay signals very far     feet is the max  not ideal for large commercial     
158,5.0 ,                       pros  this applies specifically to setting up this extender to accept amazon firestick content  the extender delivers a strong signal when placed between the tv and modem  my indication went from  poor  to  very strong   it s small  unobtrusive and easy to see the front panel  this is an excellent choice  the images and streaming are better than      cable broadcast  i give it   stars for the signal delivery and image quality    stars for the difficulty in setting it up  better instructions would have helped cons  i do not have a smart tv in the distant family room  i bought this because i have a netgear modem and thought it would be  plug and play   the instruction booklet says to pair the extender with your modem with the wps buttons  i tried this several times and it would not pair netgear to netgear  disappointing  the second method is to set up a new network  if your wsp option fails  you will need to discover the extender s signal      gext  and install a new network on your computer with passwords  etc  turning on your tv  you must go through an extensive menu setting up the pairing  after two hours  the tv was now streaming firestick content last headache  after getting the tv to work with the extender  i used the computer to check e mail and my wifi gave me messages that isp protocol was absent  the extender setup crashed my wifi and none of my other devices could access my modem  after an hour of attempts to reconnect everything using  disconnect  and reinstalling my original network  i was ready to return the extender  firestick and forget streaming  as a last effort  i unplugged my modem  ethernet cable and phone line  waited five minutes and re connected everything  voila  everything works  all my wifi devices  televisions  firestick  extender  such a hassle  but the extra content is worth the effort  if possible  find a neighborhood nerd to help you      
159,3.0 ,                       overall  it works pretty well  the range extender is about    feet away from my computer  through   walls separating a set of wood stairs  but i don t get full signal strength because i bought one through the amazon warehouse  that had likely been tried and returned  it wasn t a clean installation experience  even though i attempted to reset it before i started    it took over an hour  with netgear tech support  to figure out that it needed a special hard reset  after that  the install went smoothly  it was absolutely not worth the money saved to go through the extra hassle during install      
160,4.0 ,                       pretty easy to install  i bought this device to extend my wifi to the front and side of my house where i have to wireless cameras and a doorbell camera  i have an old house with a lot of bricks  and stones  my cameras were always failing and going offline because the signal from my router was not strong enough to get through the structures even with my router in its best convenient location  since i ve added this extender to the front of my house all my cameras are always reliably online and i can see whatever s going on or who s at the door if i m not prepared to answer in person i set mine up as instructed but used the url instead  i have dual band and i did name the two  extended  ssid s the same as my home wireless ones and gave it the same passwords  the two extended ssid s were given  ext  added to the names as extended  nothing else connects to this device as its sole purpose was for the cameras only and to test the device before i bought more  i will continue to test it out and update my review if anything changes over the next month  if all goes well i ll be buying two more  one to extend my range to my yard or garage and one for the rear bedrooms in the house that get low wifi signals read the it network engineer guys review and follow his instructions if you need help      
161,3.0 ,                       the product worked as designed  but i was unhappy with the throughput and the software based setup was crap  this coming from a professional software engineer   a company like netgear should be able to put together a better user experience than the setup software affords  truly junk the device is nicely built but i was hopeful that  while all repeaters will slow your throughput  it wouldn t have slowed it to the degree it did  the furthest device from my router had signal prior to introducing this device but it was poor  i purchased the device to improve the signal strength  which it did marginally  but after introducing it  the throughput was so much slower and we ended up just tossing the repeater and going back to the faster  but weaker signal ultimately we ended up purchasing a netgear a      wireless nic  and installing that instead of the extendeer  and in place of the integrated wireless nic  and that made a huge improvement to both signal strength and throughput  i d suggest doing something similar instead of buying this product  good luck      
162,5.0 ,                       i bought this for my landlord  the condo i used to live has a strong concrete wall that blocks the cell signal as well as wifi completely  this product is good enough for me to connect the wifi since he only lived across the hallway  however  i was a little bit lost when i was installing the software and sign up for an account  especially for my landlord who is senior   so better ask some young people for help if a senior couldn t fully understand computer      
163,2.0 ,                       the product i received was used  i do not mind paying for an item for a fair price  i was under the impression this item was new  until i received the package and realized it had been opened  there were scratches on the product  slightly dirty  etc  i cleaned it up  etc  its working  but it pisses me off that i was sold a used item from a alleged reliable source      
164,1.0 ,                       first  i had to figure out on my own how to set it up  installation instructions on netgear left a lot to be desired  luckily  i do have a lot of experience with these type of things  after several  i mean several  hours  i got it set up and the wifi signal extended to my husband s workshop  that worked for   weeks  count them    weeks  then  our modem went out and we had it replaced  i figured  no problem  i d set it up again  set up up the same way i had before  the way in which i figured out on my own how to do it because the instructions on netgear leave alot out  i got the    gz network set up  but the  gz network wouldn t work  so  i go back in and set up the  hz network  but then the setup for the    gz didn t work  back and forth for   hours  finally  somehow  don t ask me how  i got them both working  with a huge sigh of relief  i placed the extender in the same place where it had been before but while it was connected  there was no internet  checked the troubleshooter  that said it had an invalid ip configuration  i messed with all of the settings  doing everything it said on the internet about this issue  nothing worked  called netgear  we put it back to factory settings  and tht thing refused to be set up  wouldn t work at all  luckily  it was still under warranty  sent it back  got another  because it did work for   weeks  set it up  had green bars all the way  for    seconds  then  connected  but no internet for the    gz  called support  she had me set it back to factory settings  and then told me to connect to the network  the extender network  i told her   we just set it back to factory settings  there is no extender network  we now have to set it up again   she had no idea what i was talking about  said she would talk to her boss and call me back in    minutes  a half hour later  no phone call  so  since i am soooo experienced in setting this up now  i go through the steps to set it up again     gz still has no valid ip configuration  i threw it back in the box and packed it up to send back for refund  i m going to another manufacturer      
165,2.0 ,                       i thought we were perfect candidates for this thing  we have a few rooms that you have to be in a certain spot in order to get enough wifi to use the internet  even though the extended network signal was much stronger the quality of internet was awful  within minutes i had someone reporting that their youtube videos kept buffering  they got back on to the original wifi network  got in their spot and it was back to normal  i tested around the house and signal drops off dramatically and fast and even right next to the extender i could not get through a   minute youtube video without buffering multiple times  i tried moving the extender closer to the source and that did not work  it actually made one of the problem rooms have worse reception than the original wifi  it was easy to set up though        
166,5.0 ,                       i order     items a week from amazon but very very are electronics due to bad experiences i ve had in the past this  however  was not one of those experiences   we purchased a piece of land for our double wide here in the mountainous boonies of western north carolina  we were told monday that it d be another    days before they could hook up our cable wi fi so  no tv    no internet    no cell service my    year old would ve left me no other choice but to rip her arm off and proceed to beat her with it the router for our cable company internet is in a far back bedroom of a trailer      feet away  up a hill and through   total walls   we ran a drop chord  plugged up and placed the extender on top of a bird house outside  about    ft from the house w  the router  and covered it with a tupperware bowl the back end of our home   my little girls room   is a little over     ft away from the main modem router   yet  my daughter is currently in her room  watching netflix  with zero buffer or load time  while doing homework on her macbook and facetiming a friend  meanwhile  i have the firestick  another laptop and my phone all on the wifi with no issues we went from not even being able to see the network name  even if we walked out to the porch  to having full signal bars and running numerous devices with no problem i thought this little guy was too inexpensive and too small to get the job done but i was wrong if you re undecided or hesitating   cut it out  just buy it  and if you re concerned about money  use the klarna app and split it into   interest free payments  no credit check  my your wifi for ever be connected       
167,3.0 ,                       these are just meh  i don t think we get any better signal with it  than without it   they can be a bit of a pain to connect  they drop signal just like anything else  this is our second one in attempt to improve our crappy internet  of which the provider says there s nothing wrong   enter eye roll here  and we ve seen no improvement  maybe yours will work better   fingers crossed      
168,3.0 ,                       the iten was very easy to install  connect and use  i can t understand why folks had trouble using this  the instructions are simple and easy to follow  however only marginally helped how i was hoping it would  i imagine there are better and more effective products that will do the job better but cost more  this may be a classic example of  you get what you pay for    while i am not terribly pleased with this product  i did not return it because it works just well enough to hold on to but not well enough to give it a better review  recommend it or buy it again      
169,1.0 ,                       i have had this extender since april of        i am a computer savvy person so no issues there   not the easiest to install but okay   signal strength is adequate  not great  for most home use   reasonably faultless operation   however  changed my network router   when i went to reconnect the extender  it wasn t as straight forward as just pushing the wps setup   i had to go into the web browser setup after several attempts to get it connected with the wps   the installation required me to do a firmware update to proceed   once i did  the train came off the rails   i could now use wps as intended  but i could not get the device to connect anything to the internet  even though i could see the extenders networks   tried the netgear community and found this is a common issue with no posted resolution  after firmware update    tried calling netgear  but they gave me the runaround with no  absolutely no  help except to offer me a service support contract for       instead  i spent     and gat a different company s extender that has much better ratings and performance  don t buy products that the manufacturer causes and issue and refuses help unless you pay up   don t know what s happened to netgear      years ago or a little more  they were one of the best   but now reading reviews and comments on the community bulletin board  they are not as they used to be   after checking things out  there are better suppliers with better products      
170,1.0 ,                       tech support shows a different girl every time on their web page  but when you call a man named sam answers every time   after a while they want       dollars to help  save your money  because it may work for a while but when it quits gets disconnected or a modem change  then sams tells you to let him into and control your computer  only to tell you it will cost       dollars after he goes through your computer for whatever reason  stay away  danger to your personal information and no reason when you buy something have to pay every time you have a problem      
171,4.0 ,                       worked as described for my situation   i bought a security camera and installed it in the front of the house   my wifi did not reach that far so i purchased this wifi extender   as described  you do have to play with where to put extender so you get good wifi signal from your router and to the device you want   it has been a week now and i haven t had any disconnection of my security camera   for my houses configuration  wifi extender could only go about    ft away from my router   that being said  if you have a really big house  you may need two wifi extenders  one on each side of router    good price   in my case  mission accomplished      
172,3.0 ,                       if you do not configure this device via wps and instead want to use the included web server to configure it to your network  you will find that it forces you to create an account at netgear before bringing you to the real configuration page  i find this behavior on the part of netgear pretty abhorrent i found a workaround on youtube that shows how to get around this  you basically go to the config page  and rather than enter the information required for the netgear account  just edit the url to go to mywifiext net start htm  note that the system also stores a cookie on your computer with a session id  which may keep this from working  so best to do this from an incognito window that aside  i ve had the unit up a couple of days now and it seems to work fine      
173,5.0 ,                       works great  super easy setup with wps  wifi protected setup   we recently moved my wife s office to the front of the house  and the router went with it  this meant that many devices in the rear of the house could not get a strong enough wifi signal to operate  including our alexa switches  echo dot  etc  so i bought this range extender in the hope that it would provide a stronger signal to the rest of the house   and it does  i was most impressed by ease of setup  i used the wps feature on my netgear router and in just a couple of button presses the extender was up and running  you do need to reselect the wifi network on your devices   the new network will be the same name as your old router ssd     ext   so its easy to find and select  the unit is also quite a bit smaller than the one shown in their video which is nice since it takes up an electrical outlet space  bottom line  this was a great purchase  highly recommend      
174,1.0 ,                       followed the directions for set up  device would not sync with my modem   numerous attempts failed called customer support  told my item past it s warranty   despite being purchased   days prior   then put on hold   after    minutes  they still couldn t fix the problem i will never buy a netgear product again   i would have been better off buying a cheap chinese device follow up   i bought a tp link ac     wifi extender   it worked perfect with the tp app   installed and ruining in    minutes      
175,1.0 ,                       basic fact using a  range extender  or  repeater  will  at the very best give you     the speed of the signal source  learned the hard way   this particular range extender is weak  all this type of stuff being made in china makes it hard to judge if the cheap price is the result of slave labor or very marginal product hardware  try to read between the lines on that sort of vague statement  spend at bit more but expect slower speed almost no matter what you spend  the higher price should correspond to greater transmit power amazon is a great place to find out what does and does not work      
176,2.0 ,                       i bought the netgear because of the name and past purchases  initial setup was a fairly easy set up  that s when everything started to go wrong  i spent   hours working to resolve the     and     band issues  i could get     to work then     wouldn t work and visa versa  then once the     and     bands were connected  i was unable to access the internet at all  so  only one band works at a time  my expection is the device needs to work right out of the box without requiring tech support to assist or resolve      
177,4.0 ,                       i got this because my wifi signal is very weak in my area of the property  included in my rv lot rent  so i can t complain because it s weak   it has improved my signal so that i can get online anywhere in my trailer  used to be only in the back of the trailer   but not much farther  it s worth what i paid  but if you think you ll be streaming netflix on the edge of the original signal  you will be disappointed  it might be stronger if i could have plugged it into the main router  but    i m not going to ask my landlord if i can trot into his house to improve my wifi  and    it improved it enough for my purposes  so why bother   i ve heard that it resets constantly or quits working after a few weeks  but it s been working fine for going on   months now      
178,5.0 ,                       having recently purchased an r     from netgrear  which proved to be a great disappointment  i was hesitant to try this product  the r     barely covers    feet in range  verified with support that this is  normal    this device  however  covers a good    feet quite easily on both the     and  ghz bands through typical house drywall walls  etc  as expected   ghz drops off first  my canon printer  which would routinely drop a connection with the r      has been steadily up since connecting to this device  connecting to it and setting it up were a walk in the park  basically connect to its web address and follow the prompts   absolutely a necessary purchase for several conventional wifi routers  there have been a few folks who reported short lifetimes  if that occurs i ll edit this post      
179,5.0 ,                       excellent product  was super easy to setup  one button push and the extender accessed my wifi without using a password or complicated setup pages  router is on main floor and puter is in basement and extender in between  maybe    feet away  i simply entered my router password in basement puter and viola  i could only get   of   bars signal strength before  with the extender i have   of   bars now  also is super tiny size  like about size of cigarette pack and you can still use the other outlet  highly recommended      
180,1.0 ,                       i tried to extend network to other end of the house   i thought i did not have it connected to my router as it did not improve my network at the opposite end of the house   at the far end of the house i could get the same signal strength as the extender   i was    yards from my router and right next to the extender and the signal strength was stronger from router than the extender   i was getting a speed of    mbs from my router and at the far end of my house i get about   mbs   so i tried the extender and the extender gave me   mbs did nothing   junk junk     
181,5.0 ,                          years ago  i wired my house with cat     except for my home office  i haven t had much use for it since everything is wireless   at least until i started using more wireless devices in my living room and i realized how bad our reception was at that end of the house    my router is from netgear and is    years old           and i am renting my modem router from xfinity  downloading had been slow and intermittent   coverage was so bad that i had even gone over my gb s with my wireless service a few months because there were times i didn t realize i wasn t getting enough coverage from my router i downloaded an app by ip tools to tell me what kind of wireless bandwidth we were getting around our house   in our living room  the app showed that we were getting about    mbps  or less  out the     mbps my router offers forward to a few weeks ago   i went online and found this extender   i bought it not realizing that it had an ethernet input   i thought the port was for output only    doing an online search of the subject  everyone who asked about extenders with ethernet inputs were told there were none available   instead  they were told to buy a second router  when i opened the box and looked at the instructions  i read that the ethernet port was for both input and output   i plugged in the extender  followed the instructions and tested the output   i was amazed the app on my phone read that i am consistently getting     mbps in my living room   wow   i have no idea why i am getting so much bandwidth   but i ll take it the product  super easy to install and it is lighting fast the product s owner   super excited      
182,5.0 ,                       got this as a replacement for another older model netgear extender that died   plugged it in and it initially worked great but then the  router  lite kept turning red   after reading several reviewers who had the same problem i looked into changing the position of the host router   since i had no problems with the old extender i didn t even think to start looking there   well  after moving the router around a little bit  bingo  that solved the problem   strong  green  signal on the extender and it is much faster than the older one   if you have this problem try moving the host router first   almost sent it back but glad i tried that   very satisfied now      
183,4.0 ,                       this is a great cheap solution for wifi dead spots  the wps set up works and is very simple  after that you just plug it in where you want it and connect to it like you would any router  if you follow the instructions  it takes less than    minutes to set up  with a bandwidth of     mbps it s sufficient for     rooms max  depending on your wifi  a couple of quirky things about it  that may be unique to my setup  about half the time it takes   attempts to connect to the wifi  the first attempt usually results in a  connected no internet  message  but once you connect it s perfect  secondly  the led indicators seem inaccurate  i ll have great signal strength and fast speeds  but the led will be red as if there were no connection all in all it s a great quick and affordable solution for expanding your wifi area  definitely recommend      
184,1.0 ,                       received this around the  st of september tried to get it to work it showed to be connected with full service moved it to the place i needed it connected good as soon as i tried using it it dropped out i thought well my signal is too week my computer tech came by yesterday he tried reprograming it and we tried connecting where the router and modem is it done the same thing dropped out when tried to use it for a search  he took it back to his shop and downloaded up dates he emailed me last night it would not work no matter what he tried my return has expired wit amazon so i guess its another peace of bad hardware to add to my collection      
185,5.0 ,                       i just started working from home due to the world burning down around us  and i was sent a voip phone to use that needed to be directly connected to our router  the problem is that the router is tucked in one corner of our home  whereas my office is in the bedroom  one option was to get a very long ethernet cable that would be hideous and annoying to manage  so i searched for other options  that s when i discovered wifi extenders  i am still not sure how they work  but i am positive that this one works great  i have not had any connectivity issues at all  even when my computer connects to it by mistake  i really got it just for the phone  everything runs smoothly  i would definitely recommend this as the other options are bulky  unmanageable  or extremely over priced      
186,1.0 ,                       very easy to install  bought it to extend the wifi  but didn t really see the difference on signal  ended up using it to connect to the internet with an ethernet cable now that i m working from home  and it s been holding up great  update            the wifi extender worked very well at first  it was holding up well while teleworking  using it for  hrs  monday friday  about a month ago  i noticed that the computer started saying that there was no internet signal from the network when logging on in the mornings  i had to unplug it and plug it back in every morning before i started working  now  it s cutting out while working  since all of my work is internet based  this is a huge inconvenience  i m going to have to look for a new extender to use  really disappointed since it has been working so well for so long      
187,5.0 ,                       i live in a condo  so why the heck would i need a range extender  well  good question as my netgear nighthawk sits atop a centralized armoire downstairs  but even the best routers access points can t seem to punch through the odd material used in the walls of my condo  chicken wire     i tried a brand x extender  what s the difference   i thought  and got a crappy experience of drop outs and mediocre connections  and it only relayed the    ghz network to boot   on my second try  i did it right and plugged in the ex      bam     ghz throughout my second floor  would have saved money and heartache if i had led with this one      
188,1.0 ,                       update  through sheer dumb luck i was able to connect to this device  everything below still stands  the wps light was never solid  i just happened to look on my networks list and the ext showed up  from there it s an easy setup but it didn t go like it says in the included instructions  the range extension isn t overly impressive but at least i can get signal now in the furthest reaches of my apartment doesn t connect to my router via wps and the web address they give in the instructions doesn t open to a page that has any tab for  new extender setup  as it says  it gives me an error message and tells me to log into my router to find connected devices  i don t know how to log into my at t router and how could it even be connected when i haven t connected it  netgear  like every other company has zero support  can t even find a phone number for support anywhere on the site      
189,5.0 ,                       wife s iphone frequently lost the  internet    home   house is  old  construction  plaster on wire mesh and lathe  therefore less optimal than drywall for wireless service    installed the netgear ex     dual channel range extender  now her iphone stays connected   price is very affordable     good bang for the buck   setup is straight forward and easy   the netgear phone app  makes it easy to see  determine test  dead   weak spots in the house    making locating the extender optimal  for enhanced coverage i did not rate tech support  setup was so easy it was not needed  nor did i rate gaming  i am not the target audience for  internet  gaming      
190,5.0 ,                       this is a very good product to have  it does exactly what they say  no more buffing in my fire stick  it reads through walls in your home  you no longer need to use ethernet cords to extend your wifi coverage  this product is all you need  program it to your existing wifi  log in on the internet and lock the wifi so your vehicle hackers are not able to receive hit spot notifications for free  you even get a free vpn for added protection for free  i recommend this to anyone looking for an inexpensive wifi booster     
191,2.0 ,                       first  i should state this could be a compatibility problem or user error  but i tried two of these and they both did the same thing   after setting up fine and working for a few minutes  the red light came on indicating i had lost internet connection   also  the unit was very warm  i exchanged it for a new one that did the exact same thing   i have a netgear router and i am have used the netgear n    wifi extender for years and it works great  i wanted to add another wifi extender in another area of my house  so i thought i would try the ac      i returned it and purchased another netgear n    and it works perfectly   i have had great success with the netgear products and will continue to use them      
192,1.0 ,                       netgear is normally a reliable company  and this seemed to work okay after a very complicated setup  the problem is every few days it drops out completely as if it s brand new and it wants you to sign in on the internet and give all your details and information again or else it can t work  so we give up  i m returning it to amazon      
193,2.0 ,                       while the product was very easy to get started i was hoping the increased signal would allow for faster data transfer   how very  quickly it became clear even at distance my current router is far better suited then using the extender booster link    from my isp   g from the router allowed for speeds of    mbps connected to this extender i was gettin less then    this requires a hand shake between the router and this device if you don t have the right set up it will cut the performance in half  i did not have equipment that functioned with the router well  even if i did it still appears to be far fetch to come near the level of performance most  users would hope for in its implementation a tri banded router might be used to see the best results       
194,5.0 ,                       plugged it in  told it during setup to use the same password as current router  and viola   up and running  i had a bridge which only works with the     ghz section  and i already had    more devices on it  kept dropping out because the only place i could plug it in and connect with an ethernet cable was just on the edge of the     s range  plugged this unit in  and now   units are off the original      giving it some breathing room and the new     range is strongest where it used to be the weakest  fartherest from router   if you need more range  this is a life saver      
195,5.0 ,                       my house has   floors and wifi gets a bit spotty in some rooms  i tried other extenders before but they didn t really work and connection to the main router was lost all the time  this one has been working amazingly well for a few weeks now  and i am actually using the  ghz now in the entire house  much faster   my only complaint is that it is not compatible with netgear smart connect  not an issue for me now because the whole house has a good  ghz signal but something to keep in mind     
196,1.0 ,                       i bought this to boost my wireless signal in one part of my house that suffers from weak wireless signal   it was easy to connect and set up and appeared to work great   any device that i connected to it in the part of my house with poor signal showed   bars when connected to this vs   bars with no range extender device   the down side is that the internet connection was unbearably slow when using this   i stopped using this signal extender and have much faster internet speed even in the part of my house without great signal   i tried several locations  and haven t found a fix for it yet      
197,4.0 ,                       to start  i struggle to turn on my iphone so i was a little nervous going into this   after an hour of frustration of thinking i was following directions and trying to connect this via wifi and there app  i still wasn t able to get this to work  an attempted call to netgear yielded a   hour hold   to hell with that   so before i gave up i attempted to try one more attempt with it wired   bingo   it works    once i established the connection that unit works via wifi without difficulty   i am using it to stream television in a room away from router   there doesn t seem to being any additional lag   however my best download speed is   mbps out here in the sticks via satellite      
198,1.0 ,                       worked ok for a couple months  started having really slowed internet off the main router  couldn t figure out why  turns out it was this extender   it all but completely shut down our internet  after a couple months it started disconnecting from the internet intermittently even though it was well within range of the router  everything connected to it would lose connection and stop working replaced this with a different extender  and everything was fine  internet worked much faster  nothing was losing connection and everything worked as it should  for whatever reason  this extension device shut down the internet in my house definitely not worth it      
199,1.0 ,                       i purchased this product because it said it would provide better coverage and faster wifi speeds and that is not true   it was very easy to install and my signal did increase very well   however  the wifi signal speed was cut by more than      and my tv buffers even with a stronger signal   now that i have trashed the original box i will keep the device but i recommend people research their need before purchasing any of these devices      
200,5.0 ,                       i am an amateur computer diy consumer and have been at it since       i am not a professional  just an average guy who can follow directions and think a bit outside the box if needed this was purchased with the intentions of boosting upstairs wifi router strength downstairs  it does not do that what it does is it logs into the upstairs router and becomes a second wifi router downstairs  technical term would be wireless switch  guests and electronic devices downstairs would use the downstairs wifi router login  not the main upstairs wifi router login example   my wifi network name upstairs is called  harry wifi upstairs  and my wifi network downstairs is called  harry wifi downstairs                                                                                                                                                                                                     usage no one can tell the difference                                                                                                                                                                                                      installation use a cellphone and connect to your wifi extender default network name  netgear ext  then a web browser should pop up where you can just follow the instructions to setup your extender      
201,1.0 ,                       this product is a waste  the extender does not want to connect to the main router if it is more than    ft away and my    mbps connection was reduced to less than  mbps while on the  ghz spectrum  and the extender was literally next to the modem   the extender itself has very poor range  the advertising was very misleading and i had to return the product  i would not encourage anyone to buy it  if you do want to throw away your money  there are far better places to do it than on this      
202,4.0 ,                       i recently bought a ring floodlight cam for our garage but the wifi was just out of range and it kept losing connection  after reading some reviews online and on youtube  i ended up getting the ex     mainly because of the pricepoint after setting it up and finding the right spot in the house to place it  the ring still kept losing connection  at least that is what i thought  the ring was still connected to the extender but the extender itself kept losing internet connection every other week or so  i thought it was a bust until i found a neat little configuration  fastlane technology   because the extender is dual band  you can configure it to connect via  g to your router and then  g to your devices or vice versa  this optimized the connections on both ends and i havent had an issue since im a tech saavy person but my degree is in software engineering  not networking  i still dont know the root cause of the connection loss while not using the fastlane tech still curious  so if you are a network engineer id be open to your thoughts   but if anyone who purchases this device is having connectivity issues   i would highly suggest enabling this feature      
203,1.0 ,                       i am returning this  because after talking to tech support  they explained the router provided by my internet provider was unable to detect the range extender ip address they offered to come in and take remote control of my computer to try and fix it  but i ve heard of enough scams i decided to pass on this option after almost   hours of messing with this  and trying to follow suggestions we d seen online at the amazon site  i m going to take the obvious step of returning this and look for another wi fi extender      
204,5.0 ,                       i did thorough investigation on a number of wifi extends since i currently rent a concrete basement in a large house where the modem is on the top floor of the opposite end of the house  i settled on this product and could not be happier  while some people say that this product slowed their internet down too much  i did not notice that issue at all and appreciate how it really did strengthen my connection  i learned that the best place to position the product is halfway between where you are located and where the modem is to maximize communication between the two devices  overall  i would recommend this product to a friend who has poor wifi connection and is hoping to amp it up      
205,5.0 ,                       i needed a range extender to cover an office area  i needed a unit that i could plug a gigabit switch into and then an encryption device into the switch  as well as several other units that needed a hardwired connection  once i got it setup  i found the range extender actually provided a stronger wifi signal to the house than the primary wifi router  couldn t be happier      
206,5.0 ,                       i have a big house and my cable modem router s wi fi    g or  g does not provide adequate coverage  i use the netgear ac    to amplify the wi fi    g and  g signal  set it and forget it  after you do the simple setup you plug it into a wall outlet and it works  the speed is not that same as connecting directly to the router but it is about      for example  my wi fi  router is about greater than     mbsnetgear to the router is about    mbswithout this  i would not be able to use wi fi    g or  g from everywhere in the house  great product and easy to use  i am using a motorola mg     cable modem router  i also used this product with an arris surfboard modem  there are no compatibility problems      
207,1.0 ,                       i have wi fi extender from other brands also but i have this connection drop issue only with netgear ex      it drops connection even you use ethernet to connect  it seems to be design flaw  can t return now because i threw the box          changed rating to   star  no issue with wi fi range or connection but it drops connection every few hours which make working remotely very difficult      
208,5.0 ,                       was searching for a way to boost my wifi through my   story loft condo  thick brick walls and high ceilings made the signal lessen on my lower level  i figured i try this given it wasn t a major investment compared to a total mesh type wifi network  followed the instructions and it worked flawlessly  initially it had a new network name  in addition to my existing network   quick search online showed me i could rename the wifi extender  network  with the same name as my current network  now my phone or laptop doesn t know any different and just switches over to the extender when i m downstairs  and wifi is the same name  and i have full bars always   flawless solution      
209,3.0 ,                       works well for extending wifi to the upstairs rooms in our house   as others have described though  the setup was fairly complicated even with the instructions  connecting to the setup screen didn t work with the first pc that i used and i had to try a few different devices before i could log into the device to configure it   apparently certain devices operating systems aren t compatible   after a few hours of messing around with it  i did end up getting it to work and it seems to be doing what it s advertised to do   my only complaint is that i wanted to use it as an access point and not an extender and i still haven t been able to get that working properly   it seems to cause a conflict on the network when set up as an access point and your devices keep dropping connection      
210,4.0 ,                       this little unit has really helped my wifi reception in my back yard and shop  where i was not getting good signal or any at all  i am now getting a strong signal and speeds seem to be fine   the only thing i don t like is that it operates on a different network than my main wifi  so when i walk back into the house  if i get too far away from this range extender and need to be back on the original network  i have to manually switch back   but for the price  i can t complain      
211,4.0 ,                       i ve only had this up and running for two days but i m impressed how it solved my wifi problem  reason for just   stars is because it s early and because i rarely give   stars for anything  as for my use  i have an att uverse modem made by arris  the att wifi is able to cover most of      sq ft  fairly well from a back corner of my house where my office is located  problem was that i have a nest outdoor camera watching the driveway at the front of the house  the modem wifi had to pass through three walls including a brick wall to get to the camera  as a result the camera was often going offline as for setting up the ac    the process for me was simple and easy  but be patient  it takes a few minutes  maybe   to    minutes to get it powered on  booted up and shaking hands with the modem via wps buttons  all of that is very easy but i did wonder at first if it was working  after powering on  going from a yellow light to a green power light took a few minutes to complete  similarly  after that and moving to the wps handshake it took a few more mintues for the process to complete and then a little more time for the ac    router light to turn green and showing all was good  if you need  ghz just do the wps handshake a second time the ac    default is as a new wifi access point but can also be used as extender of the original wifi  i went with the default new access point since it seemed to be suggested  after the handshake i placed the netgear halfway between att at the back of the house and the camera overlooking driveway in the front at this point is where things became a bit more difficult  getting the nest camera to see the new wifi took a lot more time and a few trips up and down a ladder  there does not appear to be an easy way to just switch access points on a nest cam so i ended up removing the camera via nest app and then adding it back as a new device  that gave me access to all the wifi networks close to my house and i was able to sign in to the new access point  the camera is up and running and so far has been stable with no drop outs  i also did a check of the original modem s internet speeds   both ethernet and wifi  and there is no decline in speeds from before installing the ac     i also checked the speed of the new ac    access point  the new wifi is not quite as fast as the original access point but still well within spec needs of the nest cam      
212,1.0 ,                       to start off  i bought the extender to give me a better connection from my router to xbox  my router is in my living room and extender is in my room  about    ft apart  just a wall in between them  connected the extender to the router using all the step provided  using  g and  g networks  tried using  g connection on xbox from extender and lags more than connecting to router  tried using  g connection and extender drops connection every     mins  updated firmware and did a factory reset  set everything back up and tried again  same thing   g laggy and  g drops everytime  also used ethernet port from extender to xbox  once again  drops every     mins  i also messed with my router settings  allowing ip pass through and all because the extender was giving my upnp errors on xbox  but still  my router gave a better connection than this  entender      
213,5.0 ,                        st read nicolas kaiser s review  thanks nicolas  super review    then follow my superstitious behavior  it worked       did the wireless wps set up once  it didn t work  did the wps set up twice  it didn t work       so i left it on and        went to work   came home and the extender was still not connecting to my modem router  so just for kicks and giggles i did the wireless wps set up yet a third time exactly as nicolas directed and       it worked perfectly  and has continue to work      since   obviously there is a definite pattern here  so hail to the volcano gods  read nicolas  review  then completely disregard reason and rationality and follow my superstitious dance   the evidence indicates the dance is programmed into netgear s chip       who would of thunk it        
214,5.0 ,                       we had a problem with the wifi connects on one end of the house  all the other connects were pretty central to the router and worked fine   a tv and my wife s tablet were the only two things at the  dead  end  well not really  dead  but more like sick   slow and with intermittent loss of service for what ever reason one option would have been to attempt to relocate the router to a more central location   a lot of work rerouting cables and the probable expense of new cat  cables to reach   the other option was this product   a really simple solution  basic you are done in minutes   yes i did have to add the new address to the tablet and the tv but that too was easy and quick we now have faster connections and no more drop outs of service on that end of the house   the wife is happy and that makes me happy and glad we purchased this item      
215,5.0 ,                       i purchased two wifi extenders  one to reach downstairs to the kitchen and another to reach tv s in the bedrooms and outside deck  i found these to be very simple to connect to the existing wifi  you simply plug the extender into the router and then move it to what ever location you need  plugging it into a receptacle in the area needing the boosted signal  it s that simple and prides both a   g and  g connection  i would  and do  recommend this product to both friends and family  as well as a stranger  great product  i cannot rate the customer support because i did not need them      
216,5.0 ,                       a few months ago  i had purchased a     ghz wifi extender to improve the quality of our wireless networks  my family couldn t stop thanking me for improving the range  but i felt like streaming and voip quality was still lacking  we use internet calling apps   so  i looked up a   ghz range extender and found this one  which also has     ghz   so far  as long as you re within a decent range of your original router  this should do the trick  we have a smarttv that we use to stream with and it has drastically improved since i installed this little box  my family has never complained of lack of internet connection ever since  now  i ve recommended this little device to others and  so far  everyone seems to like the larger wireless range  and  for such a small box  it does a great job      
217,5.0 ,                       this net get gear wireless range extender is a great piece of gear  it simply plugs into any available outlet  range adds another     square feet of wifi coverage   have a large house with main wi fi router in basement and on the second floor another cisco commercial access points  both have external     ghz    db gain external omni directional antennas   antennas per access point and basement has   antennas  commercial grade antennas  the net gear impldevice simply attaches to any available access point or router in under    minutes  you simply have net gear join the router and use the same password as your existing router   that way your wifi will  auto join  the net gear when you go out of range  once joined the netgear publishes it self on your wifi net work asas another access point with the same name name as your rounder with   myrouter adds a second item   myrouter  ext  and for me it allows way better signal on the first floor also takes signal into my garage and way out to my shop in the back of yard  it also has an rj    jack for computer or printers  must have item  once set up you can move it around to any plug to get your wifi signal anyplace you want a good signal      
218,4.0 ,                       boosts wi fi signal well in a   story townhouse  from router on  rd floor to the  st   and re distributes good speeds aross several devices and a pc connected to this ex     s ethernet  it was eaay enough to setup using the same credentials to connect other devices to a router  although it does get really warm  it will only be connected for limited periods at a time  it automatically reconnects after relocationg to other outlets      
219,5.0 ,                        fan was added by me the netgear ac    exceeded my expectations   my wifi was in the front downstairs bedroom    story house  no signal  nd story opposite corner diagonally until i added the extender  it works great  i put my upstairs tv on the  g and now netflix no longer buffers  loads right up  my computers are on the  g band and they work great  i did see the comment about getting too hot and so i wired a raspberry pi fan that only pulls     ma  tied it into the power source inside and mounted the fan  i know   void warranty  but it works   i have not had any problems  time will tell  but it is working great  maybe the fan is something netgear should consider      
220,5.0 ,                       so far i am loving this  my laptop was getting really sluggish wifi signal in my basement  finally figured out that the wifi hardware inside my laptop is only rated for the    ghz signal  this little beauty can pick up the  ghz signal and then i can plug ethernet directly from the laptop to the docking station  i went from a top speed of about   originally to    with the ethernet cable  well worth the money      
221,1.0 ,                       bought after seeing the thousands of good reviews  i get    mbps download  mbps upload from my internet provider  as proven using speed tests right next to the modem router  i wanted an extender that i could conveniently place to catch the signal about   ft from the modem router and extend it        ft to the rooms upstairs  i verified that i was getting an      mbps signal from the modem router right next to where i placed the extender  however  i found that upstairs  even after using the extender  i could never get a signal more than      mbps  with or without the extender  eventually  i simply put the extender right next to the router  and finally found that even then     i couldnt get more than      mbps  but without the extender i was getting an easy      mbps  this thing is just not built for high bandwidth  imho  if your requirement is similar  hopefully this review is useful to you  i m probably going to end up with mesh wifi even though its more expensive      
222,1.0 ,                       if i could give negative stars  i would   my netgear ac    wifi range extender arrived exactly on time and looked terrific   the problems began as soon as i opened the box and tried to read the instructions   as others have noted  the instructions were written by someone who clearly doesn t speak english as a first language   the  simple  first set up option didn t work because i didn t have a corresponding security button on my router to push   my router is supplied by my cable provider  time warner cable   not to worry   there was a second option   that option begins by giving an ip address to type in my browser   using three different browsers  safari  chrome  and firefox  i got messages saying the address i was searching for doesn t exist   called twc and spent more than an hour on the phone with them   no luck   called netgear   they said the ip address in the instruction booklet wasn t the right address and  in fact  i shouldn t type anything at all   i was instructed to open my wifi options to connect to the internet  and look for the network neatgear ext   i was actually able to get the device to work that way   it worked  poorly  once   when i closed my browser  it quit   i called netgear back and they started to walk me though it again   they spent    minutes adding new firmware to my unit  one of those horrible hidden reset buttons that require pushing a paper clip for    seconds while i was standing upside down    still didn t work   netgear finally concluded my unit was defective and i should return it to amazon for a replacement   that s where i am today  waiting for a replacement   once i get that replacement  i ll update my review      
223,4.0 ,                       i purchased this item because streaming gaming in my bedroom often led to constant buffering of video lagging  so far  it appears to have helped my bedroom gain a better wireless connection  although it does sometimes still lag a little bit  even though i m being shown my connection is strong   the set up was actually pretty simple  which i was afraid of because of other reviews on this device and similar devices saying it was hard  but the instructions walked me through step by step  and i was able to do this from my laptop as well as checking the connection from both my laptop and my mobile phone  i will update at a later date if the usefulness of this extender changes  but so far i am a happy customer      
224,1.0 ,                       i bought this and just opened it   the first step is go to a web site where it will display new extender set up  it doesn t  next free support  yep doesn t work   i entered the serial number but the next button doesn t allow me to hit it   try community  nope says i have an account but since i don t know the password there is no forgot pw option so no option to get help  already processed for a refund  what a waste of time      
225,5.0 ,                       i m in a house built in       with cinderblock walls in the basement and plaster and lath walls in the main house  half of the rooms were getting a feeble signal from the router in the basement  i placed the netgear box in a spot in the main house that avoided the cinderblock obstruction  and it boosted the wifi signal to the remoter part of the house by one or two bars   so  complete success  this was one of the cheaper extenders i researched  reasoning correctly that signal propagation did not require a sophisticated device  set up was easy  even without wps  for what it s worth  the light displays on the device don t seem to correspond to anything relevant to the effectiveness of the signal propagation      
226,5.0 ,                       this item made all the difference in extending our wifi into a corner of the house that our universal gateway router just couldn t reach   it made all the difference in being to convert two tvs in that part of the house over to using roku via our wifi so we could eliminate renting two of the small auxiliary cable boxes from comcast for which they just raised the monthly rental charge up to    per month apiece   so  that s a savings of     per month off our cable bill for a one time cost of     for this extender and     for the two roku units   so  it all pays for itself in less than   months and then we re ahead     every month after that   the best part is that with the rokus we get all the same channels as our main cable dvr box instead of just basic service we were getting on the little comcast boxes      
227,1.0 ,                       i bought this extender because of all of the great reviews  plugged it in and synced it to my wifi  all of my devices recognized it quickly and asked for the password  same as existing network    hours of factory resets  cycling and following the instructions over and over  nope   youtube    a number of instructional videos   none of them had instructions on how to remedy the  password  discrepancy   googled my issue looking for tech support  i couldn t find anything for netgear   no support  i did find a site that looked just like netgear s  site the color and layout was the same   the     support line took me to india   they walked me through the instructional process i received with the extender  after   hours of this they wanted access to control my computer    it will be faster  i asked them to talk me through it  they said they would for       so they presumably had the solution all along  they say  but wouldn t give it to me unless i pay   i said   it will cost me     to get my     extender to work  good bye   then returned it      
228,1.0 ,                       first of all   setup  a lot of people have complained about a difficult set up and others have said it was amazingly easy  i found it to be neither  the wps connection business didn t work for me  i read someone else s review later and it said that the included instructions were no good  so  maybe that was the problem  i did a web connection set up and it set up on my guest network fine  but took a lot more effort to set up my primary network  it kept saying my password was wrong once i got all of that going  i left the extender in the same room as the router and moved   rooms over and it lost the signal for my  ghz networks  with some finagling  i was able to get it to reconnect to them  but the signal was weak  i primarily bought this because the description said it would boost internet speeds  i performed speed tests on   different websites and all of them showed that the extender actually slowed my download and upload speeds  the speeds on the extended networks were slower and i ran another speed test on my regular networks after disconnecting the extender and even they were faster once it was disconnected i thought about keeping it if it would simply extend the network  i had my cousin  who is in the most remote location on the property try to get online and she could even pick up the broadcast of the extended networks  she could  however  see my non extended networks being broadcast  in short  this really doesn t work      
229,2.0 ,                       poor wifi signal   eh  tech support  but easy to install  the signal does not go as far as it is advertised  still struggle to catch a signal when i m just on the other side of the door from it  i updated the firmware  which didn t do anything  tech support was a miss  unknowledgeable reps kept walking me through resetting it over and over again  which did not fix it  tech said it s just a low signal unit  told me to buy a more expensive one next time  but it was pretty easy to install      
230,2.0 ,                       so i dont know how new or old this model is  but i bought two and neither worked as advertised  im in the process of getting a refund right now  the seller sent me the product in a timely manner and i believe the devices to be in working order just from unboxing and appearance etc     however  when i set them up to extend my ac network  i could never get the ssid to broadcast properly  and devices that attempted to connect when the ssid was visible  said no internet  they had limited connections that never fully sync d in  my router and the extenders were maybe    feet away from each other these extenders were the same name brand as the wireless router i use and i thought this would help  it didnt there are forums online that say the netgears have trouble with the symptom i describe  even though the forum starts out by saying its occurring on an n     the issue seems to occur with all models im going to see if another brand will help      
231,5.0 ,                       this is a review post installation  long term usage tbc overall   contextthis is awesome  my apartment is       sq  ft and the router is at the front of the house  i previously couldn t get even a single bar of wifi in the back of the house i placed the netgear extender in a room between the front and back of the apartment and i now have full bars of wifi in the back room setupsetup was reasonably easy and intuitive  i followed the instructions step by step and was up and running in about       minutes  the only snag is that when i removed the unit from the front room  you need to do the setup near the router initially  and then plugged it into the desired location  it wasn t working at first    because my computer had auto defaulted back to the original network once the device was unplugged  it should be on the new network   so check to which wifi network you re connected if for some reason the device doesn t seem to be responding      
232,3.0 ,                       this thing looks and works great boosting the signal to one of my security cameras     but the journey towards successful operation was one i hope to never repeat here s a message for netgear  when you develop a new product and you are ready to launch it to the public    give the product and instructions to one of your grandmothers to see if she can easily get it going     if not  go back and work on it until she can  and i believe that no other electronics company will be able to compete with you i could go on about my trail of frustration while getting this thing online  but the final straw was after all was working and it demanded that i register this product   it would not accept my credentials since it said i was already registered with netgear  and that i was using the wrong password    so it sent me a new password via email    still would not work  so i tried to register as a new customer    nope     so i finally had to register it under my wife s name  so now i have to remember a whole new set of info     now comes the job of reconnecting to my extender under the new credentials  nope  wont buy that either     make sure that no children area around when you are going thru this    were not done yet    because when i tried to log into my nighthawk app the next morning  it locked me out because it said it wasn t me    another hour of frustration  and that finally works again   you don t get a phone number to call for help until all the registration crap is done  so you are left out in the cold     besides  other reviews on here suggest that netgear support is all but useless i have about a dozen netgear items  so i m sort of stuck with them    i wish my daughter would have married a nerd so i could find out what company to use besides netgear for any future electronics purchases      
233,3.0 ,                       when we first had it plugged in and set up  everything was working as it should   after a few weeks  the router signal turned red even though the signal is fine   i found another person online who was having the same issue   ran speed tests and they were good  as expected   moved the extender all over the house and actually  the closer we got to the router  the signal didn t get better as expected   confusing but good to have as a back up if my original signal is having a bad day      
234,4.0 ,                       we were having a little problem in getting a strong wifi signal in one area of our den     router is upstairs  setting up this extender was very easy  followed simple set up instructions provided and just plugged it in a downstairs receptacle   it help a lot  but we may have been expecting more but could be our problem as we ve added quite a few new wifi  toys  that need use to move the router or get a mesh system  based on what the cost was and what we are getting   glad i tried it      
235,3.0 ,                       there is nothing this can do that moving your router modem can t do  i spent time moving things all over the house  in the end  i ended up not using this  because the signal from my router was better than the extender and i had them in the same place as a test  i have a nighthawk      that i turned into an ap with my xfinity modem in a different room  i mean  this isn t bad if you re out of options  but don t expect it to do wonders i did experience some speed reduction and disconnecting when connecting to this as well  again  if you re out of options this may help  just don t expect the clouds to open and a ray of light to come shining down      
236,2.0 ,                       i set this extender up per instructions  then placed it    ft away from the existing router and    ft closer to the xbox  after running speed  and signal test this extender has less speed and signal strength than the router  the extender also constantly drops signal kicking me out of games  i am now contacted to router directly      
237,1.0 ,                       i am a pretty tech saavy guy   i bought this thinking this would be plug and play  there could not be anything further from the truth we have spectrum in nyc  formerly time warner   we bought this to have coverage over the office space  our settings for wps would not work for whatever reason  so we had to proceed manually  little did i know that i would start a journey into a deep rabbit hole  between repeating the instructions multiple times  tweaks  constant signal resets of the extender disrupting the flow  and customer service holds and repetitive instructions  i literally spent   full days trying to make it work   customer service was atrocious  i spoke to   different people  of which only   could speak decent english   interaction him   find internet settings menume   there is no such thingme    i read the list to him him  we need to find the menume   ok  but this makes no sense  don t you know the menus i can see  him   no  its the prior model  we don t have troubleshooting manuals for itme    what   if this was a car from last year  do you think it would be acceptable to sell a car without tires  just because the car was older    how can you not have the manual for this  him       anyway  the only thing i can say in their defense is that i have spectrum  and that company is atrocious  as are their services  the actual knowledgeable support lady did say that customers with spectrum run into issues  if that is the case and it is known  say it in the buying page  netgear     do not sell garbage known not to work  if you are wondering why i did this for   full days  it is because we really needed it   we started new jobs working remotely and there were a lot of zooms to be attended in summary   avoid like the plague if you are a spectrum customer      
238,4.0 ,                       gave   stars b c i ve only used this   days now  works efficient  very important follow instructions don t think you don t your better than the manuel or this won t work properly  if you have dense concrete floors in your house then maybe google mesh is better or an alternative router  overall a great buy takes   mins to an hr set up  and if for some reason this doesn t work try  factory reset then try again     
239,3.0 ,                       i researched the wi fi extenders on amazon  and this one seemed the best   instructions say   press   buttons and viola   instant wi fi   not so much   i had to get netgear tech support to walk me thru a different way to pair up the extender   good tech support   by the way   we finally got it hooked up after about   hours of fussing with it and learning some new  colorful metaphors   and it did work to get a much stronger wi fi upstairs      
240,5.0 ,                       i bought this unit   years ago  i am very impressed by the signal strength of this extender my home office is upstairs where my router is placed  it s an old netgear wnr    v  router which i bought    years ago  the signal strength outside my home office was very low  especially in the main floor i barely had any wifi signal  i have a    mbps internet connection and standing directly in front of the router  i get only   mbps speed  if i step out  it drops further i ended up buying this extender and connected to my home lan network ethernet port downstairs in the master bedroom and vola  i now have    mbps wifi strength in most areas of the main floor except one guest bedroom which is far away from the extender on the other corner of the house so i bought another extender and tried to hook up to the same lan in the guest bedroom but for some reason it didn t workout  seems like you can t have multiple extenders on the same network online at the same time maybe  i m not a networking expert  so i couldn t figure out what was going on and hence i ended up returning the  nd unit but i am happy with my initial purchase and still have that unit  in my master bedroom downstairs  currently i am working from home and typing this up  sitting on my guest bedroom upstairs which is directly above the master bathroom next to the master bed where the extender is and  i get     mbps internet speed compared to my old router  still in the home office  directly across the guest bedroom in plain sight  and  and it gives me barely    mbps speed  i need a new router for sure  but this extender is definitely my hero and worth the price my doggy chewed it up when i first bought it  so it has some scratches and dents on the exterior but still performs like a champ         
241,1.0 ,                       i can t begin to describe how angry i am about this product  the support chat connected me with a tech who remoted into my computer  i thought they were doing it to configure the booster so i didn t stop them   then  in seconds they removed malwarebytes and installed malicious software that put up a screen that showed tons of infections in my computer and the guy scared me into paying        to clean it all  said the booster wouldn t work unless this was done   they tried to get me to spend a lot more  but i stuck at the basic removal  after this all happened  i contacted norton support which confirmed i had malicious software on my computer and removed it  i also found another contact chat for netgear  and the tech said the  contract  the scammer had me sign was not associated with netgear in any way  i m now in a fight to get the charge reversed on my credit card in visiting numerous forums online  i read very similar stories from a lot of people who bought netgear products and tried to get support with them  bottom line   this is unacceptable         
242,1.0 ,                       this product is very difficult to connect to the router  i followed the instructions for wps using the option to join a secure wifi network without typing the network name and password   that s all great  a  gext and  gext showed up as extensions  until you try to connect a device the only way i was able to connect a device to the extended  gext or  gext was to connect wirelessly with a fairly new chromebook by pushing the wps button on the extender   then  once i was on the wifi extender network  and only then was i able to get to the mywifiext net at netgear s site to set up the extender and get a password for other devices   most devices i have are not new enough to connect to the wifi extender by pushing the wps button on the extender   once i got the seriously long    character password  i was able to connect other devices to the wifi extender   no where in the set up is there an option to choose your own password the signal is great but the set up is unreasonably difficult       
243,1.0 ,                       setup was simple  but the  g ssid never worked  i tried everything  many master resets  reconfig   g only  etc  it would connect to both  g and  g networks  but only  g worked   g would never allow an internet connection  nor would it allow access to the extender s config website  latest firmware was already in place  looked up issue online and apparently this has been a known issue for more than a year      
244,1.0 ,                       failed direct ethernet connection in six months  wifi connection unstable   g doesn t work  even when it connects with    g  speed is even slower than connecting directly to main router two rooms away  admin interface not very useful  every time you make changes in admin interface and save  it loses connection to main router and kicks you out of admin interface  you have to wait up to   mins to reconnect your devices  waste of time  unfortunately  return window is closed  i ll be looking for a cisco product      
245,1.0 ,                       sure it got here quickly and it is easy to plug into the wall but they never said you have to run ether cables and then everything has to go on line one at a time and find the ping then set up    it was a lot of trouble   the service they have you contact didn t have any more luck than i did   just returned it for refund  they were good about it   not worth the trouble   maybe for someone more equipped to handle this     
246,1.0 ,                       this adapter sets up a separate wifi network that will have a different name and different password than what you currently have  so your devices will have to log off one network in your living room  then log onto another network in your bedroom  i feel you find that acceptable  please be aware that the network created by this device speedtests slower than the original network  i don tknow if the one i got was defective or what  but i returned it because it caused my network to be slower  not faster or stronger      
247,3.0 ,                       after initial set up  which i found easier to do with the web interface than the wps button  it worked really well for   or   weeks   then it lost connection to my netgear router   neither the router nor the extender had been moved  the only way i could reestablish the connection was to do a reset to factory defaults  then reinstall as if it were new   that worked  but then this problem reocurred   days later   i noticed some others reported a similar problem  i am returning it to amazon for a refund and have ordered a different brand to replace it      
248,1.0 ,                       i really needed a wifi extender  or so i thought  this did not play well with my netgear r      it would literally kill all of my wifi  not a single device anywhere in my house would be able to connect  it would work great for a day or so  then bam    no wifi for you   i did everything to try to make it work right  i assigned a static ip outside the dhcp pool so that there was no issues with renegotiation of the link  made sure it had the most up to date firmware  tried multiple locations  all with good signal    it was just not worth the hassle      
249,4.0 ,                       one button easy startup  not so  i was able to find it on my networks on my computer  connected to the range extender and it actually worked after about the   th time of trying  by the time i attempted to break through the middle eastern language barrier  after being on hold for    minutes  i actually figured it out  netgear puts the  cuss  in customer service     
250,3.0 ,                       first of all  and probably most important  my streaming woes are a thing of the past  however  my apartment complex provides campus wide wi fi  and i couldn t get the plug in feature to work  since the access point is not part of a router   it s part of a mysterious control panel in my coat closet  a tech savvy friend was eventually able to use an ethernet cable and get the problem solved      
251,1.0 ,                       set up was not bad  while i did have both bands show up  the  ghz band never was usable  no device  note    tab s   iphone x  could connect to it when i did get the  ghz band to connect  i got roughly     the speed i normally do while about five feet away from my router  this was about      mbps to somewhere between        tops i did three factory resets on the device  tried both wps and manual set up per the netgear instructions  power cycled my router  forgot the networks on my devices  and got similar results every time  as a whole  this product sucks  i m returning it  stick to tp link for quality networking products      
252,1.0 ,                       if you enjoy spending hours trying to get something to work  like when printers first went wireless  then this is the product for you initial set up was fairly easy   took a time or two  but it finally got there   but  after about a month  i couldn t do anything when i was connected to it   it slowed considerably to almost a crawl so i tried to update the firmware    nightmares ensued   it was horrible i could connect to it with almost any device  but i couldn t log into the netwifiext net site to do any maintenance   it would either tell me that i wasn t connected  even though i was and could go to other websites  or it would just go to a  you ain t got no wifi  screen it looks well built  but it s trash   worst money i ve spent on amazon to date      
253,1.0 ,                       netgear s range extenders may work great    i ll never know because they re impossible to set up  the  quick start  instructions  in broken english and confusing  seemed to be missing steps  the online screens they referred to could not be found  just lists of things that could go wrong  all did  and     numbers to call for help  so i called  got person with such strong asian accent she was unintelligible  i stuck with her  even allowed remote access to my computer  she said my computer needed a  serious cleanup  before range extender could work  and they  softree  could do it for only              for a really complete job     finally it dawned    netgear s tech support is a scam  i didn t fall for it  i got off the line  i m returning these extenders and never buying a netgear product again   if you think i m exaggerating or stupid  try getting netgear tech support to install their range extender      
254,5.0 ,                       i was a little concerned about this extender but it has great reviews   it is very easy to setup  read the directions    if you have to reset your router  a press of the wps buttin on the router and a press of the wps the button on the extender  within a couple of minutes  it s back up   i highly recommend this product        
255,3.0 ,                       i ve had this device for a few weeks and have been unable to find a spot where it actually helps my network access  i bought it with intention of increasing network accessibility in my garage but did not succeed  i will probably take it out of service  i have a different brand of network extender serving an outbuilding on the other side of my house and it seems to work well      
256,4.0 ,                       i received and set this up at my house about   weeks ago  it was very easy to set up  it has improved my speed in the adjoining rooms where i normally use my ipad  my only disappointment is that i had to put it in the hallway    feet around the corner from my router to get it to work  when i plugged it in one of the adjoining rooms it did not work very well i have not had it long enough to comment on its durability and versatility      
257,2.0 ,                       this thing is unreliable and quite frankly  a piece of junk  i wish i had not thrown the box away or i would have returned it  when you buy from a trusted name like netgear  you should expect quality  not so in this case  this thing loses connection almost on a daily basis  sometimes it corrects itself but other times you have to unplug it and plug it back in  i needed this for my internet connection for my ring cameras located outside  when i lose connection  i lose the ability to view any surveillance footage from my ring cameras  again  this is the reason i purchased it i will be searching for another one and it will not be a netgear product      
258,1.0 ,                       piece of junk  wps button didn t even work on arrival  no matter how many times the button was pressed   no blink from a light  manual setup is clumsy and extremely slow  it looks like device from     s  when finally connected to the existing wifi  keeps rejecting connection attempts from every other device  for the devices where connection is accepted establishing connection takes more than a minute  what kind of hardware is inside   goes back before amazon return window closes  there are much better choices for wifi extension      
259,5.0 ,                       i don t know what some of these people are complaining about  i took it out of the box  read the instructions  linked it to my  g network and moved it to the room i needed it in  i then connected an ethernet cable to it and my son s pc  internet speeds went from   mbps and   bars wireless to    mbps with no signal loss  upload speeds went from    mbps to   mbps  long story short  this worked like it should have on a side note  i haven t tried it wirelessly  but the product does say up to   mbps wireless speeds      
260,5.0 ,                       got this for mom s senior apartment to use the community wifi to run her magicjack  with her phone number   there s some youtube videos on how to get it to work   you need a computer to program the extender if you don t have physical access to the router  we didn t  we only have the wifi password   but now months later the only hardware in mom s room is this extender  the magicjack  and the phone   gambled     that it would work and it sure does   buying another one for our house so we can move the home phone  also on magicjack  away from our router and ditch the cable that wraps around the room      
261,1.0 ,                       revised          now no matter how many times i reset it the  g will not work   i purchased this just to extend the  g for  smart outdoor switches  and i can not turn my outdoor lights on or off now   a waste of money   not worh the cost for only a few weeks if working   when i first called tech support for my initial set up  they were kind enough to offer advanced help at a minimal fee  needless to say i will not try calling them again             it is less than    feet from the router   it disconnects several times a week   it will not turn back on untill i unplug it   plug it back in      
262,3.0 ,                       i bought this to boost signal for a ring doorbell  it did not work out  i have another extender in operation for other purposes in another part of the building  they did not like co existing  this one just would not cooperate  i finally boxed it up and put it away  i will use it for some other application where it operates on its own  i was disappointed      
263,1.0 ,                       not only is it difficult to connect  once a connection is made  the signal only lasts a few seconds  even when it s right up against the main router  it s too late to return because i spent several weekends following all the directions in the manual and online with no success until i used the connection wizard on my iphone  now it will connect for about    seconds at a time   lol  the headline is trash because that s where it s going  don t even think about buying this on sale  total waste of time and money      
264,5.0 ,                       so     i am not great with technology  but thankfully my fiance is  i recommend taking your time to read the instructions though to make sure everything is set up right  i did have difficulty setting it up because i was not picking the correct point in the house to put the extender  that s where my fiance came in to save the day  it just took a few tries to find the best point to put this in the house so everyone has decent wifi      
265,4.0 ,                       i bought this because there s a wifi dead spot in my bedroom  i have a small house  and the room farther from the router than the master bedroom has no wifi issues  so idk why  but i consistently had problems getting wifi in my bedroom  i could connect to my wireless network  but i would only get    mbps  which is not enough for netflix  this little device did solve my problem  and i now get a decent connection with about      mbps  i get  up to    mbps  for my main connection  normally around        the setup didn t exactly go smoothly though  i kept getting error messages and trying again  and i was ready to give up and send the thing back  but it turned out that despite the errors  the setup had worked at some point      
266,5.0 ,                       my network printer is inside a cabinet at least        rooms    or   walls  away from my wireless router which is in a closet  plugged the extender into a wall outlet by the cabinet  followed the easy to read and understand instructions assigned it an address on my network and was up and running immediately  connection light was amber for the first day but still connected seamlessly to my network  been solid green since then package was delivered early and undamaged  highly recommend the seller      
267,5.0 ,                       this wifi extender really helps in our house  our house isn t all that big  but the internet hub had to be located on one end of the house and there are several walls between that location and the other end of the house  and the signal across the house wasn t very strong  i installed this range extender and it really does boost the signal strength to the rest of the house      
268,4.0 ,                       in my apartment  the only working cable outlet is in my bedroom at the one end of the apartment while the living room is at the other end   it s a pretty long distance   my wireless router s  g signal fades drastically due to the thick walls in between the   rooms   normally  if i have strong wifi signal  the download speed hovers around     mbps   but when i go to my living room  i ll be lucking to pickup any signal solution  i bought a wireless router  didn t do much research and didn t want to spend much money so i went with this   easy installation  just plug it in  and their website makes the software setup very easy pros   it works   easy setup   extended my wifi signalcons   it did cut my internet speeds   went from     mbps to    mbps   looks funny the drop in the internet speed was not a big issue to me  i expected it and the speed i have now is still good for streaming and gaming   plus  the extender was needed to bring signal to an area that barely had it  anything speed    mpbs would ve been acceptable to me  if i were to use this extender for a wider coverage area  the speed reduction might have been a bigger issue  but i don t so it s not   overall  i m happy with it      
269,5.0 ,                       the product was easy to install  plug in near to the router so you can pick up the signal  activate  and log on to the new wireless network using the password for your router   the final location for the device is where the signal is weak  there are extraneous instructions which may be designed for alternate  older  network configurations  the instruction manual refers to a link for technical support  unfortunately  the rep on that line was more interested in selling me a security product than helping me interpret the instructions   i suggest that you call netgear directly for help      
270,4.0 ,                       i suppose when  something is difficult to set up and use but then works well that s a good thing   i had trouble setting up this extender because i just don t think the instructions are current and up to date   i didn t even think it was working well until much later after it was set up and installed but it seems to be working very well   i have a very small house and for some reason my modem signal doesn t reach my bedroom very strongly   i got the extender to capture the signal from the modem and send in a line to my bedroom so that both my smart roku tv and my laptop on my desk get a strong enough signal to operate properly   they seem to be working much better using the extender      
271,4.0 ,                       over all great product  i did have some troubles installing and did call tech support  by the time they actually got on the line i had figured it out i do notice that i loose signal every now and then for reasons i am not sure  i basically unplug it  turn it off the back on and it connects again     
272,5.0 ,                       i am not a networking person  but i needed to expand mine   i purchased it to extend my dual band network   i had just installed a ring pro doorbell camera and i needed a stronger network outside my front door   i picked the ac    as a compromise between speed and price   the setup instructions  i used the wps buttons  were on the money except for two things   first  they didn t say how long steps would take after pushing buttons   it takes longer than i expected  it probably took less than a minute for each step  but it felt like     so don t panic and after each press of a button  give it time to do it s thing   even plugging it in and waiting for the power light to stop flashing and turn steady green takes time  second  to finish the setup  they tell you to open a browser to  mywifiext net    guess again  i tried my cell phone and my laptop and keep getting error messages   after googling  mywifiext net  i found               as the extender s address   type that in your browser and your all set   one last thing   when i tried to register it with my phone and i got  error      every time   so i gave up and tried my laptop   it worked perfectly   i got it registered without a hitch   i connected my doorbell to the extender and it has worked great      
273,1.0 ,                       recent update to my extender has me removing all the netgear extenders from my network   after a a year of mostly flawless service my netgear extender  i tried reconnecting to it  it  kept forcing me to login to a netgear management site   you have to create an account if you want to manage your devices through the app   it allows you to bypass this but it routed you right back to the netgear login when you try to connect   originally  setup involved login directly to the extender and giving it the home router name  security settings and password and your were done  now it force you to the new management app when trying to connect by phone   directly plugging into  an ethernet didn t help bypass this step and  still sent me to the website to sign up for the online management   so even if the you want to use it  you have to register it and store your router name and password in your account   i was going to do it just to see if it was useful enough to be worth the effort   two different phones tried to create and account and logon to set it up and  it just tries without ever connecting   tried for an hour to get it set up and never could login   it probably is the same for my other netgear extender that suddenly stopped working asking me to login to their network   i have tp link extenders that currently setup like this one used to   so i may go get some more of those or start using old routers as extenders again   i don t know if there is a way to roll back the version and prevent updates but i ll research that too      
274,4.0 ,                       love the easy of logging into this and extending your wifi   you can even give it a new name my only complaint is that when the power goes out  it gets named  netgear  again  and you have to log into the device and re extend your wifi if you re using this to extend wifi for a security camera or device  this is an issue  because your device ends up going offline and not coming back online until the extender gets reset   so you could potentially be out of camera footage during and after a power outage      
275,5.0 ,                       the reason i bought this was not to get faster speeds like some people have mentioned but instead was to extend my actual signal  to my entire house i use wifi cameras on my property and unfortunately my router isn t close to all of them  with this that no longer is an issue but definitely look into changing the name on your wifi extender if you buy one  it s easy to do     
276,1.0 ,                       the wifi extender would not connect to my router   went to website as per the instruction manual   was immediately called by customer support   from india   after wasting at least    minutes messing around with my router  the extender  and my computer  the support technician told me that he needed another    minutes and     to make my system work   no thank you   bait and switch   wished now that i hadn t given this person access to my computer and router from half way across the world   who knows what kind of problems i could end up with as a result of this   i m very sorry i ordered this product   in hindsight  the whole process of getting access to my system then trying to upcharge me seemed too seamless and planned   don t buy   i sent mine back        
277,5.0 ,                       i have a tablet located in a far corner of the house that was getting intermittent signals  this baby took care of that problem   the instructions take some reading because you have to connect this device near your wifi system first then there are   ways to set up the device   i started with the first method and it worked for me   it was easy to set up   there are some videos out there as well   good luck      
278,5.0 ,                       bought this to extend our wifi to our office so i can plug my work laptop which i can t use wifi on  and hid it in my heavy wooden desk  which normally can degrade wifi signal quite a bit  but the speed test with my laptop plugged into it via ethernet cable shows it s still about     as fast as direct connection  ethernet again  to cable modem router in other room   if that was confusing  i just meant to say you can use it to get a wired connection to a device just using your wifi signal to this amazing device and or you can use it to extend your wifi signal much further using the wps button you can connect it to your main router just by pushing it on each device  which connects to the     ghz signal  and do same process again for it to connect to the   ghz network  if your router is broadcasting one   then using the web interface  you can tweak setting and make sure its all good  my only gripe is that the app to access this device and find best locations etc  is as of march      avail only for android  not ios  which hopefully they will have soon  i bought an off brand version of this and it was a total nightmare to try to get to work   netgear is a good company  and the setup and instructions were a million times better and this is still a great deal   highly recommended      
279,5.0 ,                       for how well it preformed i couldn t be happier   i ve never used a wifi extender before but it had step by step instructions that are pretty easy to follow but my mind is a little slow   after installing it my internet speed has increased about   to   times the usual   i do recommend placing it about halfway between the device you are trying to speed up and the router   it seems to help stabilise the connection updated january  th      still working perfect  i saw a post where it said the prongs got burnt and nearly burnt the house down but i believe that may have been an issue with the house or possibly with that batch that was made maybe   the pictures i just took are of the back and no burn marks at all   once i save up some money i ll try out a netgear router later      
280,1.0 ,                       i have a one level home and needed this for my outdoor ring camera  i followed all of the guidelines and i was definitely close enough to my router and this was close enough to my ring camera  but it would constantly drop connections and the signal was weaker for this than it was from my router  the camera worked better from the router instead of this  you have to unplug and re plug this thing in every few hours  i have  gb internet service and even with wifi i usually get    mb download speeds in my house  with this extender even if it s plugged into the same room i m lucky to see  mb speeds      
281,2.0 ,                       it does what it s supposed to do but it s very frustrating  almost everyday it decides to kick me off the wifi  when you try and reconnect it just says no internet connection even though other devices are connected to it and are working just fine   i either have to reboot my device to reconnect or unplug plug back in the extender in order to reconnect  sometimes when i just lock my screen it will completely lose connection with the extended and i m only a few feet away  it will refuse to connect unless i reboot or unplug  if you run the microwave  it completely cuts the signal out  i tried calling tech support but they won t do a damn thing for you unless you give them an email address at beginning of phone call  i m not playing games  if i call i just want my shit fixed  i don t want to play this game of give me all your personal info so we can incessantly harass you with emails  i d try a better and more expensive product  this company and device suck      
282,4.0 ,                       the device works well and setup was easy  some reviewers seem to be confused by the instructions  but i found them to be clear and useful  setup on a wps network required less than   minutes  and my wireless devices connected easily by setting up the pair of new networks     ghz    ghz  as a wi fi on each device  again  very simple performance of the extender has been good after about a week of use  the home in which i live has an odd collection of walls that seem to make the existing wi fi signal weak in certain areas of the house  the extender appears to be making these cold spots disappear  which was required because i work from home and use the google fi phone service over wi fi  the extender was purchased to eliminate dropped calls resulting from these cold spots  so far so good  although more testing over a longer term will allow me to assess the product and quality   also  the netgear app can be used easily to test the strength of your existing  and new  wi fi signal in various areas of your house business  the app helped me place the extender in the most efficient position to provide a solid signal throughout the house      
283,2.0 ,                       easily connected to my netgear router and had no problems with devices connecting to it  the app was very helpful in finding the optimum location  having said that   the connection speed from it to any devise was no better than half the speed of my router itself when placed in the best possible location   which it cannot be in as it plugs into the wall between ankle and knee height  in that regard  there was little to no benefit of using it as it did not really extend the wifi signal  i would not recommend it      
284,1.0 ,                       i work in it for a living setting up and troubleshooting internet connections  so my terrible experience with this extender is not a result of my own ignorance  the set up process is terribly frustrating and vague in every way  even after confirming the setup was completed  the extender would say that it didn t detect a connection and send me through the setup process again  this happened   times  the extender constantly loses connection to the router no matter how close the two are together  netgear  how hard is it to make a product that isn t completely useless  this thing is a joke      
285,1.0 ,                       after following easy instructions  plugged in extender in second more remote plug  did not work  everything lights green  but no light for wps so no connection possible    so i went to the web site they have in their instruction booklet  and there is a  chat  window   do that  and they will have a technician call me in a few minutes   a little odd  but it is the netgear web site in their booklet so it s legit right        tech calls with thick accent  asks superficial obvious few questions  i am pretty tech savvy so no new info  no help   then  pretty quickly in conversation asks for my computer password so he can access my computer   i say no  he persists   warning bells going off major   after i flatly refuse  he says another higher level tech will have to call me in about half an hour and ends call   nothing after that   looked at my recent calls and he called from  coast to coast vacations   i can t believe that an official site provided by a longtime reputable company is a huge scam   but it is  and reading other   star reviews has me so glad i said no to computer access   so if you re thinking about ordering this  read a lot of the   star reviews   oh   and on top of all that  the signal extender was a piece of junk   even at the first strong plug site near the router  the signal was weak      
286,4.0 ,                       i attempted to follow included instructions for setup and kept coming up with internet not available then i noticed i was already online   the extender practically set itself up because what i was doing wasn t working   works great for plugging in my analog dvr via ethernet cable to allow remote monitoring of outside cameras      
287,5.0 ,                       i should have bought one of these a long time ago   i live in a remote area   our internet services are known for being terrible   don t even ask about cell services   i do recommend putting it in the room you have the router already first to pick up the signal   then move the router and device  if that s what you re wanting to do   before i could only pick up a signal in the bedroom if i was sitting right next to the router   now i m writing this from my living room and couldn t be happier   thank you      
288,1.0 ,                       after installing the netgear wifi extender ex      i performed a series of speed tests using ookla  and the xfinity speed tests   the speed  coverage achieved with the netgear extender was significantly less than without the extender in the same location   i called netgear tech support and i was persuaded to let them access my computer using remote desktop control software   to make a long story short  after well over an hour when the correct set up app was installed on my computer i was given over to another technician who informed me that the  assisted installation will cost       i declined the offer   if netgear had mentioned at the very beginning that technical assistance on their part will be billable then i could have had the information to make a choice whether to proceed  as it happened   after over an hour just trying to install their preferred set up software   via remote desktop control and then tell me that their support will incur a minimum      charge was sleazy and unprofessional  i would not recommend this netgear product or the company netgear      
289,2.0 ,                       based on all the reviews it seems this product is hit or miss  for me it was a miss  the setup instructions are simple so when that doesn t work where do you place the blame  wps is a simple method to setup any device  push button on router then push button on extender  but what happens when that doesn t work  you troubleshoot  i have a netgear router so communication should be transparent  i mean you can t blame it on compatibility  so maybe the button on the router isn t working  in netgear you can log into the router to do wps  they call it soft button  immediately it lets you know it is having problems communicating with the extender  ok  hard reset the extender  no joy  give up on trying wps which was the recommended way  try the software setup  some success but not total  after a few hours you have to ask yourself is it worth it  seriously it shouldn t be this difficult  i mean we haven t even tried to tweak any settings  so all the reviews that were a hit  congratulations you were lucky to get a good unit so if you re feeling lucky take a swing  amazon has a great return policy if you miss      
290,1.0 ,                       just awful  our home is      square feet and we reset this extender probably once per day  it constantly shows disconnected  we can never access the  g  we ve tried to reset it  reset the modem  you name it  currently shopping for another one      
291,3.0 ,                       first unit defective  replacement seems to work i have a dual band n wireless router   at a point about    ft  away through   walls  my laptop indicates a   bar full strength connect to the router   at the same point this netgear extender indicates a  green   strong  connection to the router   with my laptop within    ft unobstructed to the extender  i can connect to the router on     and get a   bar full strength connection to the extender   nevertheless  within    minutes  often less   the extender will lose that ability to get internet access   this occurs despite continuing to indicate   bar full strength connection from laptop to extender and continuing to have constant  green   strong  connection indicated from the extender to the wireless router i returned the unit to amazon for exchange  amazon s return procedure was very smooth  easy  and quick   the replacement unit was delivered to me within    hours of clicking the link to return    i just got the replacement a few hours ago   i followed the set up instructions just like the first time   this time the unit seems to work      
292,1.0 ,                       when this extender works  it works great  the problem is that it often spontaneously stops working  sometimes a reboot gets it going again  sometimes not  i contacted customer support and they had me upgrade the firmware  that worked for a while  so i didn t return this product  but now that i can t return it  it s back to having the same problem again  do not purchase this product   it s far more trouble than it s worth      
293,1.0 ,                            waste of money  wrongly marketed   this will not extended your network  it makes you create new networks  this of course makes you redo the sign in for any devices you want to use  so now the devices can t decide whether to link with the original network or try another  a huge pain in the ass to set up as it is not really plug n play  if you don t at least run a real laptop you ll never get it linked up right  negative   stars     
294,5.0 ,                       purchased a ring doorbell that hooked up fine upstairs where my cable router is located   but when i took it out the front door on the other side of the stone wall of the house  the doorbell had a very spotty wifi connection   purchased this netgear range extender and plugged it in to an outlet in the living room about   feet in from the front door   solved the problem  now the doorbell is connected to the extended network on the netgear device and works fine      
295,1.0 ,                       instalation wassuper difficult  i tried chatting with customer service twice they were very reluctant to help   then disconnection me twice  tried calling neveegot an answer  i went on youtube the person on there showing video was helpful and i think it may br install but im not       because tv is buffering more than ever before  i ll be sending it back if noone will help   so disappointed     
296,3.0 ,                       i just took this out of my network   it got me though some time  but really it did not completely solve my connection to a wifi access coming in from the garage   my impression  again having not tried this before  was it just brings more channels on the air locally which was the problem in the first place   i had alot better result spending more on a new adapter for my computer  spending around the    dollar mark for it   now that really works well      
297,4.0 ,                       i bought two of these to extend our wi fi range into our driveway and onto our deck  where the signal was spotty and inconsistent   i ve only explicitly tested the results out on the deck  but i was really very impressed with the improvement   i sat out on the deck with the ipad for hours  streaming music videos from youtube  with barely a drop or a delay  and immediate recovery from the rare delay   prior to installing the extenders  it was rare to get through one video without interruption of some kind  and a bit of fussing to try and  kick start  the wi fi signal again regarding installation  installing one is very easy   the process literally takes just a few minutes and you re good to go   i installed two  and could have benefited from a warning or information explaining how these work   the installations went exactly as described in the instructions  but the instructions fail to mention that  when you install the second one  it ll broadcast the same ssid names as the first  and you won t be able to tell which is which   it s not a huge deal  but consider this  each extender broadcast two new ssids   my android phone showed two pairs of duplicate ssids under wi fi network selection  while the ipad showed just the two unique names   even on the android  where you saw four entries  you could not tell which entry came from which extender   never having used extenders before  i don t know if there s a benefit to the two extenders using the same ssid names   it would not seem so  considering they broadcast separate ssids and you have to explicitly choose one ssid to connect to on any device   i doubt the shared name makes the connection somehow dynamic   on the other hand  using different names for their respective ssids  you can easily differentiate each extender s signal strengths and you know for sure which extender you re connected to   anyway  long story short  my advice for those considering multiple extenders would be to give each new ssid a unique name so you re able to differentiate them later  if you have to troubleshoot any problems   that is  unless you find information in support of a shared name  in which case please respond back here with a comment      
298,5.0 ,                       i bought this to use in our      sq  ft  house  shortly afterwards we bought a      sq  ft house  i got no internet in my den which is in left front and modem is in right rear at least    ft  away  set up range extender and moved it into office which it is now    ft  away and now i have a full set of bars without any loss  i am very pleased with my purchase and price was also reasonable in my opinion   p s  i have been using this for   months so i think that is long enough for an honest review   thank you netgear  t r      
299,2.0 ,                       we have a rather small house       sf  bought this to help extend our wifi range  we continued to have issues   even with a computer being    feet from it  there was a small wall between the extender and our computer  so we had spectrum service out and the tech advised that this brand is known to be basically useless  he recommended a few other for us to consider and we purchased one that he recommended on amazon and it works great  don t waste your money on this one   we weren t even able to get   mbps with it even though we have over    mbps coming into our house      
300,2.0 ,                       purchased this product to extend the wifi signal to my front living area and garage   i was not very impressed with the output speeds of this wifi extender  speeds are severely inferior when compared to your normal router   your speeds are cut to less than half of your main router   i ran several tests  all of which produced similar results   tests ran from kitchen table  which is    feet from netgear wifi extender and    feet from my router   the first   screenshots are the results ran from the netgear wifi extender s    ghz and  ghz dual bands   the second set of screenshots are the results from my router  which is also netgear brand   i will probably be returning this item and looking for a better product   as far as the distance it extends to is approximately     square feet at my house  but the signal is harshly cut off by a my front  brick  wall   in my garage  the reception is fine  but again the speeds are not what i expected update   i returned the product   netgear replied to my original review post instructing me to visit their troubleshooting page which i m glad i did not do as some of the other reviews here state that when they did that  they were engaged by  tech support  for a charge or a  bait and switch        
301,1.0 ,                       i am not a tech person   i never write reviews  especially negative ones   but i am this time the extenders would not connect to my system   during an  online chat  with the company in an attempt to connect the extenders  i was sent to a third party tech support person   he  identified  the problem as my system   for an additional fee  they could  fix  my ip addresses and the extenders would work   i was willing to pay the extra      for tech service if i was going to have thorough wireless service throughout my home   unfortunately  this did not happen and i would prefer that i just tossed the extenders in the garbage and did not proceed with any connection efforts while the person was very friendly  helpful and seemed knowledgeable  after we disconnected our conversation the extenders did not work   they did work while he was on the phone with me   i called back after a couple of hours and got another tech   he  fixed  the extenders again for me   once he disconnected  again they did not work   since i had connected my systems to the extender wireless accounts with the first tech  none of my devices would work   i spent hours not only on the phone with the tech people but also reconnecting my devices to a wireless service that would work   frustrating does not fully encompass my feelings here i am out      and have two extenders that do not provide any additional wireless coverage for my home   the time and money spent  while frustrating  are not the issue here   the extenders do not work in my home   why   i have no idea   but it was not for a lack of effort on my part both timewise and financially   i would caution anyone who is not thoroughly tech savvy to not buy this product   unless you have a way different experience than i did  they will not connect easily to your router and you will spend time and money chasing ghosts      
302,5.0 ,                       i loved the easy setup   follow the few setup steps and in less than    minutes it s all set up and able to move it anywhere in your home where signal from router is weaker i have a dead spot in my basement living room  and trying to stream netflix can be spotty at best   i decided  after buying my folks one  to buy one for myself  i find it to be an affordable way to expand wifi reach to the dead zone and it works like a charm no need for technical experience  it s as simple as plugging into the wall and following the steps it has made viewing tv and using the computer a dream  no more buffering or slow load times  it feels fluid and the way it should be note  i have a very good router from netgear  so pairing the extender to it just increased its power      
303,1.0 ,                       this product was very difficult to set up  tech support hard to reach       paid top dollar for a model that is   years old      very disappointed in the extended range it doesn t seem any better then wifi router  was expecting something that actually worked and was a new model  would never purchase this type of product from amazon again  after    days i need to pay for any tech support for this piece of junk  tech support told us router was defective and to send it back to amazon  my husband worked diligently for hours and finally made it work without tech support help      
304,4.0 ,                       this does a good job of extending the wifi signal but is not as easy to install as advertised   due to a disability i had someone else install who was putting in my ring doorbell   it took him awhile to go through the instructions and get it done and he didn t think it was that easy either  i thought it just involved pushing a button or two but that s not the case other than that it seems to be working great      
305,3.0 ,                       picked this up after being told to work from home  the set up was easy enough following the instructions  i use the wired ethernet port for my work computer and generally this extender does fine even with a ps   smart tv and a couple phones picking it up as well  i was hoping to hit my garage shop with it as well but barely has the strength to make it for the tv and xbox there  it has been functional for my work purposes as i generally am connected to a few cloud systems for file storage and using outlook via a vpn through work  it s not fast by any means but serves my purposes  my signal strength issues come entirely from placement and distance from my nighthawk to the extender and then to the shop  i was not looking to spend a lot of money at the time of purchase due to the work from home supposedly only to be a month or      months later and this little extender is still serving the purpose  if you want to have speeds to be close to your primary router and span longer than one end of the house to the other  get a pricier model  if you are just looking set up in another part of the house with an access point for work  this is fine reading other reviews  there appears to be some quality control issues as a fair amount of purchasers complain that it does not work at all or it has burned up in a short amount of time  mine worked out of the box and i have never had to contact tech support at all  i may still wind up going with a stronger model when i also upgrade the main router as kids doing school from home  working from home and trying to hide out in the shop on occasion seems to be a bit beyond the capabilities      
306,5.0 ,                       my company installed over     of the expensive version of this same unit at their retail stores and they are working great   so i bought this     unit for my house  i normally dread setting up new electrical gear as i have many issues   but not this time   this unit was very easy to set up as its configuration screen popped right up on my cell phone   my comcast router is in the basement so i put this on the  st floor   as soon as i set it up the speed of internet access increased at least     and the range spread to a nice perimeter around my house  i should have bought this years ago      
307,1.0 ,                       i had trouble setting up the router  so i called the neatgear wifi extender customer support number  i was given a    minute speech about all the warranty plans i should look into buying  even after repeatedly saying i didn t want to buy anything and only needed help with setting up a brand new netgear router  and then i was told that in order to ask anyone my questions i would need to pay     for a technician  i asked to speak to someone that could simply answer a few questions on setting up a router and he said netgear does not provide people to talk to for free  i then called a different number i found online  also for netgear  and i could barely hear him because there were so many people talking in the background  then he hung up on me  i tried calling back but it was no use  i am now left with a product that i cannot set up  the directions are quite unclear and inadequate  and have no choice but to send it back  i have never been so dissatisfied with customer service in my life  that was disheartening      
308,5.0 ,                       i m not sure what is happening in my bedroom  but my regular signal in there is weak  after dropping a few zoom calls and having to use my verizon phone as a hotspot  i decided to get an extender  the set up was super easy and i now have coverage in my room  the signal goes from strong to medium and back to strong  but that s better than maintaining a weak signal  then disconnecting  like it did before  i have it behind my nightstand  so that could be a contributing factor to the fluctuations  in any case  i am happy with the improvement      
309,1.0 ,                       well  i really wanted to love this and it would have been great to have a better signal out on my back deck  but just didn t happen  it is not obvious to me that it did anything  i found myself more often than not disconnecting from it and just connecting to my wireless router  and in my office  many times i couldn t load a website  but after disconnecting from the booster  it would load after i connected to my router  so  can t recommend it      
310,3.0 ,                       even though i d give myself a b in computer literacy  i ve never worked with one of these before   the web page the directions sent me to didn t have the button it said  and neither did my verizon router   i called their support number  and got indian people whom i couldn t understand  and who spoke very fast   my wife is better at understanding such speech  but she couldn t understand them either   we decided to send it back next day i pushed a previously unused button on my router  and it worked   after that  i used my computer s list of nearby networks to connect  and the relay works great   but i m not sure if i ll ever buy a netgear product again      
311,1.0 ,                       fails to stay connected and connect   purchased to get my wifi cameras  amcrest brand and  star btw  to be more responsive    i m a tech nerd and developer and i understand technology better than most  this pos connects then disconnects constantly for no rhyme or reason   does not stay connected   returned it after perseverance of   week trying to get it to work ignoring other reviews    will have to find something better testing connectivity with my phone did the same thing   my android phone would have to be manually connected each time even standing right next to it   reading other   star reviews i now have to agree its not the user rather the product   i won t be repetitive of the other   star reviews but agree it should be rated   star      
312,2.0 ,                       i have a       sq ft apartment  the router is in my room and the living room tv randomly pauses while watching shows die to bandwidth issues  i started hard wiring a long cord across my apartment and was getting sick of it  bought this extender and it was easy to set up  seemed great at first  it s only been a few days and my tv is starting to pause from lack of bandwidth again  seems ridiculous since it s such a small space  the extender also seems to get really hot  not sure if it s defective  i m going to give it a few more days then i plan to return this for a better model if the pausing continues      
313,4.0 ,                       i bought this to extend into my garage office  our router is located about     away on the same floor and the signal could not get through the   walls separating my office from the router  the installation and connection was simple  couldn t be happier   i placed the router inside the house with a strong connection to the wifi but i was constantly being disconnected in my office  i moved it to the garage but it got worse  i was going to return it  but i had an idea that i hoped would work  i bought a     extender and placed that one in the garage with this one in the house on the other side of the wall  my signal is really strong and hasn t dropped yet  and i do a lot of video conferencing  this may be a great product  but it s not ideal for a garage unless you have an additional extender or fewer obstructions than i do    walls   had i not bought the additional extender  i would ve returned this one      
314,1.0 ,                       i thought that this was going to be a easy installation with my router  i have a spectrum router that does have a wps button btw  turns out that netgear devices including this one does not work with spectrum which makes absolutely no sense considering that  spectrum is one of the biggest internet companies out right now  i m very very mad about this because no were in the listing did it say that it did not work with spectrum and if it did it wasn t big enough  that should be one of the first things you say in the listing  please stop selling these or at least make sure that everyone is aware that this extender will not connect at all with spectrum routers  i will now go to buy a product that does work with spectrum and return this one  thank you have a nice day     
315,2.0 ,                       this is the sort of product that would expect to work flawlessly but it does not  there are a few problems with this sort of device     i have a gigabit connection at my place with two bands    ghz and  ghz  this thing would not connect and extend the  ghz band  which delivers faster internet speed than the other  visited the website  spoke with a representative but no matter what i did  it would not connect to the  ghz  it would show the  ghz ssid but would not connect to it     the base speed  without a wifi extender on the    ghz is around     mbps with the extender  mbps   o  did not make sense to me why there was such a huge drop i would have expected a drop of around     but not so much  probably better off with a separate router if speed is an issue for you      
316,1.0 ,                       right out of the box this started causing trouble  i had purchased it as a backup in case our old one went bad  well it did  this one has a terrible manual that makes it extremely hard to do the setup required  i actually had to go to a site where someone else dealt with the same problems setting it up  i m surprised because i have used netgear items for a long time  just a disappointment in this purchase  i am a technology director for a school and have ben installing this kind of stuff for over    years and this thing will not work no matter what i do  i must have a bad one  unfortunately  i bought it too long go to return      
317,5.0 ,                       this range extender is a big improvement over the last one i tried  easy to set up without having to log in or register at any websites  i was able to set this extender up with my motorola router  but just pushing a couple of buttons  and setting up the devices to recognize the new extension code  simpy  easy  works great in my      sq ft home with three levels      
318,5.0 ,                       does exactly what i need it to do  our doorbell camera is too far from the router  so this resolved that issue  only one device connected to it  so i can t comment on the performance when multiple devices are connected  but it s been flawless for the smart doorbell      
319,5.0 ,                       i put this outside in my shed to provide ethernet to a hardwire only ip camera   it works reliably and as expected   enter your wifi information in the web configuration  and it just works   i also have it s own extended wifi enabled  so it creates a new wifi network with a different ssid outside   this is handy when i m further away in the yard and can t hit the access point in the house   just note  that doing that will be slower due to the additional hops      
320,5.0 ,                       was having some wifi issues with my bedroom tv  as my roof line is very low  it s impossible to run cat  from room to room  i did have a line to the adjoining office and considered installing another wifi router there after having no luck with typical boosters  when i saw this little unit had an ethernet input output and could be converted to an access point i gave it a try  the included directions were very easy and had it up and running in a few minutes  took care of the buffering problems i was having with the fire tv stick  the streamer is only about    line of sight feet from the netgear  ap so i can t really judge it s transmission power  i can say the speed is surprisingly better using the     ghz vs the  ghz which may indicate it s range is somewhat limited      
321,4.0 ,                       after many hours of debugging my new  comcast cgm    com  router performance issues  speed testing all over the house  i ve realized that an interior brick chimney was killing network performance   so  netgear ex     has fixed this issue   the secret   use netgear fastlane setting with router to extender in  ghz mode   then  and only then  you ll get the performance that comcast says you get to your router   as soon as i turned this on i immediately resolved performance issue in my office  on the other side of the brick fireplace  and one floor up   now i can stream tv on an ipad  run data on my iphone and run a mac all on the same wifi network via the extender   amazing   poorly documented by netgear but once you turn on fastlane this device works great      
322,3.0 ,                       i have had this device for about two years now   up until now it has worked great   it provided coverage to my living room which is on the other side of the house from my router   but recently it has been dropping the signal and i ve been having to unplug and plug it back in to get it to reset   that doesn t last long before it starts messing up again   i m thinking about getting a mesh system now      
323,4.0 ,                       his unit allows almost anyone to use a non secure public wi fi to create your own secure wi fi  internet connection  background  live in a      room apt complex which provides   free wi fi   part of rent on both a so called secure system and a   public  no password system   but due to incompetent local   gurus  that administer system both use same network for their  ghz    ghz access points  so anyone outside within    to    yards or more  can see and access those who use names  non secure printers  cellphones  etc   breaking passwords is unfortunately quite simple nowadays since older generation types do not keep up with updates  need for long passwords  etc   with a relatively simple setup and using the poorly located   repeaters    access points   as  your  router  and inputing your own ssid and password  you can make a reasonably private link to the internet for the one time cost of the unit dont know yet about there long term reliability  but with the large number of positive reviews  i am assuming it is good   upon opening my unit a few days ago  when i connected it it notified me of a new update   suggest that one wait until you have it setup and running in your location before downloading the update  other wise a complete reset may be needed of course if you have a router and ethernet  that can also be used to create a new ssid and it appears to be much cheaper extension then  the   xfinity  pucks and useful for all but the most dedicated gamers   my wi fi rates went from   to    mbps to over     even with a marginal   yellow red   input from the apt network wi fi    your milage  will vary and even knowing the ipv  address of my extender  i could not using an ipad laptop find the name or access it on the apartment network    of course a dedicated hacker could probably do so  but why  if my ssid is something like  cowplop   or  hurl     instead of  joe slow       
324,4.0 ,                       this thing has definitely increased my home s internet range  but it was not as easy to set up as pushing a button  for some reason the extender just wasn t connecting to my wifi  fortunately  i stumbled across the netgear website s online chat while trying to troubleshoot my issues  and the representative promptly set up a call for tech support to call me back within   minutes  it probably took    minutes on the phone with the guy to work it all out  but everything is great now  i never would ve been able to figure out the issues without tech support  though  i recommend just reaching out to them if you re having trouble  they were really great  and now my home internet is much improved and i didn t have to pull out all my hair trying to fix it      
325,1.0 ,                       i purchased the ac    back in march       all seemed well at first  the device setup was fairly standard for an extender  and was able to get it connected to my network within a couple minutes as of this review           the warranty on the product ended about four days ago  and as of this morning the device has simply ceased to work properly  i ve attempted multiple resets of the network as well as the extender  factory resets included   and despite my efforts the best the device will do is output a  connected  signal  but refuse to grant internet access  for those of you interested in obtaining a range extender  i d warn to pass this one up  as it seems its lifespan is only limited to its warranty      
326,1.0 ,                       originally i gave this product   stars  because it was working as promised  and the prior raters had pretty much all given it strong positive reviews  with the passage of several months  it became apparent that the unit is crap  i just got of the phone from a kafkaesque like     min run around  from netgear s philippine     call center  it would seem that they are not very interested in replacing the unit within the   year warranty  my unit simply stopped working after about   months  and nothing in terms of the troubleshooting that was done made any difference   it took some time  but it became quite clear that no  return authorization  was to be approved  steer clear  buy another manufacturer s product  needless to say  i m very dissatisfied      
327,1.0 ,                       we needed an extender so my s o could play in the living room with a better signal  the router is in the bedroom on the other side of the house   after taking over   hours to finally connect it actually made the reception worse that it was when wifi was connected to the router  the ping went from   s to    s and the lag was insane  we put it straight back in the box and returned it the next day not worth it at all      
328,1.0 ,                       this product is terrible    so disappointed in netgear  initially it took a while for me to install  finally worked  then my internet provider had to replace the router  i have reset my extender to factory settings    x over the last   days trying to get this to work properly and it doesn t  super annoying  and i ve read other reviews on netgear extenders  as i m shopping for a new one  that also never worked correctly again after a new router has been installed  even with factory reset  it will only find a  g and won t set up the  g and sometimes it won t even find the  g  super annoying      
329,3.0 ,                       this extender works fine   the problem is that when you need assistance  netgear wants more   to help you   after spending    minutes on the phone with a friendly indian woman  she told me i d have to pay for any more help   i bought the device in april  and it s now november  i declined to give them more money and finally figured it out myself      
330,1.0 ,                       wifi extender arrived quickly   at good price  it functioned fine for   weeks  until today  i have literally spent   hours through website and phone trying to contact cs because device suddenly does not accept my router  even though that is configured correctly  netgear website would not recognize extender s serial    then when finally tracked down phone    was told that a case   was needed to receive  higher priority   could not create case   id at that site  this is ridiculous  now i have a useless electronic device and can not use my devices    buyer beware        
331,5.0 ,                       i have my wifi router at the opposite side of my apartment  getting a decent signal to play multiplayer games on my ps  was a struggle  not anymore  i ve been using this for months and my rage quitting days due to bad connection are over  it works well extending the wifi signal to my ps  but i found that it s best to use a ethernet cable to plug into whatever electronic your using to get the best signal out of it  i use a cat   nylon cord cable from amazon       
332,1.0 ,                       the product is extremely frustrating to work with and performs terribly i get better speed from directly connecting to my router all the devices i have tried  multiple laptops  phones  other desktop wifi adapters  tablets  the setup process is also very tedious  e g   if you miss the last step to confirm setup success  which involves waiting for the device to reboot  connecting to its ssid  and refreshing the config page   you will end up having to reset the device and start over  also  even though it supports a wired connection  the setup  has  to go through wifi  it s just all around extremely hard to work with as one human to another  don t waste your time and money with this thing      
333,1.0 ,                       this is the third netgear range extender that i have had to return because they do not work with the  g side of my adsl modem router   my router is a smart rg sr   ac   all my other devices can access the  g signal on this router but the netgear devices cannot see it   i have spent hours on the phone and in chat with netgear tech support and the final answer i got was my router was  incompatible  with their extender   on the box it states  works with any wifi router    don t believe it      
334,1.0 ,                       deserves zero stars  got this yesterday and spent most of today working on it  could not get it to stay connected  finally called manufacturer  they took over my computer for a while to troubleshoot  told me my network was not secure and for a one time charge they would fix it and get me up and running  a charge to get their product to work  what planet do they think i live on  told them to forget it their product was being returned  called at t and their network was fine  if there was a problem it was with netgear s extended network      
335,4.0 ,                       i am still on fence with product   i work remote and it is in same room as computer   the router is in a diff  room   while i get a good signal  it seems to lack spped and continuity   i remote into the company server so maybe it just takes more bandwidth   but when i connect to the router gateway  i get better performance   this product seems to loose signal during use  causing my work programs to slow or get a no connection issue  as i have backup i have not bothered calling tech support     
336,2.0 ,                       bought this to extend the range of my wifi from one end of an old home to the other  since i can t move the original router  the laptop and playstation i use frequently lose their connections to the extended network and default back to the barely there signal from the primary router  which is really annoying edit  the extender started to fail periodically over the course of the last month  and is getting worse  i think it s overheating  but i m not sure  will try to contact the seller about potential warranty stuff edit    the seller wanted me to pay more than the product was worth to ship it back to them before they would offer a replacement  it s still overheating and occasionally cutting out after the factory reset and firmware updates they had me do edit    after a lot of back and forth with netgear  they did eventually replace the range extender  the new one has the same problem as the old one  so either the model is unreliable or there s something about the environment that s causing the issue  i ve raised my rating slightly to indicate that they re willing to work with people to some extent  and that the new one seems to drop my connection less frequently      
337,5.0 ,                       i ended up buying another brand   i struggled with this device for months thinking it was just my internet   i was wrong   the firmware needed an update due to a security issue per netgear   when i updated it the signal was worse   it dropped continually and even after resetting it nothing resolved it   so now i have another manufacturers  however  i m not going to mention them since the subject of my review is this netgear product   it s easy to set up   it just doesn t work   the signal is weak and it s only   feet from the source   it s complete garbage   when i installed the new range extender it worked perfectly   now i tried another brands as well just to test my theory and it also worked   it s a waste of money and the only thing it extends is your patience      
338,4.0 ,                       rather than a wifi extender  i purchased this to use as an access point  the router alone was not enough to grant strong signal everywhere in the house  with some rooms being almost a blindspot for the router  now i have strong signal for the whole house pro  has antennas  i can fiddle with them to improve coverage if needed        ac band normally doesn t have huge coverage  but i was able to get huge coverage  yes  i meant       ac  not       n  unused band can be disabled  helps with reducing unnecessary wifi clutter that should have been expected to cause interferences  adjustable coverage con  took a while to set up my access point  this device took significant amount of time to apply settings when i did so  too easily pressed buttons  as i was trying to set up this device  i accidently pressed the power button multiple times  which contributed to longer set up time  a lot of heat  this is expected with such high wifi coverage however  lowering coverage helps with heat issue if all that coverage is not needed  occasional disconnects  if you use wifi settings on computer or phone to automatically connect  it is very forgivable issue      
339,5.0 ,                       this range extender works as advertised  i set it up in the upstairs hall between the router and my back room computer on a samsung laptop and it works amazingly  i went from getting   to    mbps download to     mbps download  so fast and easy to set up as long as you follow the instructions and are within   feet or so of your router i tried an reidabu msrm us    before this and it actually gave me slower speeds and was much harder to configure get this and it should work with most computers  so happy with the speed of my computer now      
340,5.0 ,                       i had to move my home office to the guest room because my kids are too distracting   sad day for me   on my first day i realized my internet speeds were far slower  making it impossible to work effectively   after reading reviews  this product seemed like it would work for me  and boy did it   i followed the simple instructions and used the wpa setup method and very quickly was up and running benefits  it has multi color led lights that indicate whether the connection from router to extender and extender to device are great   good   poor   non existent   this helps to find the best spot to place the extender   i put mine halfway in between and both connections are great   i went from     bars to   bars on my laptop  it was very simple to setup and i didn t have to worry about new passwords or network ids   the network id will just be whatever it is now with a suffix of   ext  and the password will not change  it works with both     and   ghz  which many others did not   this gives me the choice of   connections   i ve found the     ghz to be more reliable in my house very satisfied       
341,3.0 ,                       got ac x version that does     and  ghz simultaneous setup was a headache  about a   hour project  config page is very slow  buggy and drops out  it had an update  it drops the wifi often during setup   i had to unplug replug over    times for   extenders i set up tipsset your router  ghz network to     channel  the extender refuses to work on some  ghz frequencies use    ghz extender   tends to be more stable with more consistent pings  i get a    ping drop on    ghzon  ghz extender i get a    ping dropdirect to router    ghz i get    ping drop  stars because i don t know of better prodcut  s eems to be reasonably stable over today without ping drops  will update this review after a week      
342,4.0 ,                       pros  this was very easy to install and has decent wifi signal  so overall it works for what we needed cons  sometimes it turns off and i have to go turn it back on  wait for it to load  and then reconnect  that part is annoying  especially if i am watching a movie or something  also  we put it in a central location and it got bumped and one of the antenna broke off  so it s not very durable overall not bad for the price we paid      
343,5.0 ,                       i ve bought two of these so far  and will probably be buying another one or two in the near future  using these allowed us to get much better wireless coverage to our second floor  my wife s computer is practically on the opposite side of our      sq ft house from where the router is located  and she would get spotty connection sometimes  using this extender fixed that for her  i bought the second one to improve the signal to our nest cameras  and it worked great  set up is simple  and using it is as simple as plugging it in and connecting your devices to it     
344,5.0 ,                       love it  set up was surprisingly quick and easy  i ve been using it for more than a year and it s been perfectly reliable  it also looks pretty cool plugged in on a kitchen wall with the netgear range extender  my wifi signal will easily reach my standalone garage in the backyard  that wasn t possible before that way i can listen to baseball games via the tunein app on my phone and a nice set of bluetooth speakers while working on my motorcycles in the garage  happy days      
345,5.0 ,                       what i didn t like was the presentence of wanting access to my computer  techs were very pushy and rude about accessing computer not helping me to set up this device  to the point of a pushing scam  i have had experiences with netgear tech support in the past with the same issues always told  your computer is broke for      we will fix it so they can install the device   there wasn t anything wrong with my pc called on another helpline phone   on a different pc tech said      to fix my pc ans install my product i bought  others have the same issues with netgear     
346,1.0 ,                       i was hoping this would solve my fire tv s occasional issues with connection  fire tv is probably the device farthest from main router  setup  through web browser  was simple enough  moved to the outlet next to my fire tv  and tested on my laptop  does not work the first time  after several tries and wifi resets on my laptop  it seemed to be working  tried to connect my fire tv to it  same thing  does not work the first time  obtaining ip address    then times out several times   after several tries  finally succeeded in obtaining ip address and it seemed to be working  tried streaming  fine for about    mins then started freezing  restarted streaming and same thing happens in a couple of minutes i ve tried wireless repeaters long time ago and found them unreliable  after all these years i was hoping technology has improved to make it usable by now  but i guess not  returning      
347,5.0 ,                       i own a split foyer home   because of working from home  my router is located upstairs  opposite of my tv room downstairs  i bought a really nice smart tv  but could never maintain a signal due to the distance  the device did the trick  no more loss of the signal  the  intuitive nature of the device is great  the setup was easy  once i found my router password  this will help me to eventually cut cable      
348,1.0 ,                       i tried numerous times to hock it up and could not get to connect  i had ouse cable company come out   but in a new router and new modem  up our wifi speed  still would not hook up  called netgear and they could not help me  wanted to charge        to do extra work to get it to work  declined   cable company also could not get it to connect  still not connected  very dissatisfied      
349,2.0 ,                       i ordered this because it is a dual band extender and i have a dual band router  a google fiber box  to be specific  and i wanted to boost the signal to some areas of my house where it has a hard time reaching  setup was okay  but could be better  not exactly plug and play  i ran into a few difficulties getting the webpage for the extender to load  not to mention the fact that it logs you out within like   minutes of no activity   really far too quickly if you are trying to do several things at once   once i did that it took me several tries to find a spot in my house where the thing would actually pick up a signal from my router  i finally got that settled and managed to get the     ghz band working just fine  which is the only reason i m giving this   stars instead of just one  however  i ran into plenty of problems with the   ghz band  it simply refused to recognize that it was there at all  on the web page for the router it showed that it was there but wouldn t connect  i can log directly onto the   ghz band  on my original router  on my phone so i know it works  the   ghz extension appeared on my phone but when i would log on it would say there was no internet connection  on my laptop the   ghz extension didn t even show up as an option  i went online and searched forums for negear and for google fiber and found that this is not an uncommon problem with this particular extender  however  after trying all of the suggestions on the forums i still couldn t get it to work   even when the extender was plugged in just a few feet from the router having run out of options i contacted netgear support and after exchanging several e mails with a person who was   bless him   trying to be helpful but obviously didn t speak english as a first language  he finally told me to return the product  all i want to do is extend the range of the wifi in my house  it shouldn t really be this complicated  i chose this product because of the majority of positive reviews it has  guess i should have paid more attention to the negative ones      
350,5.0 ,                       i was so happy when i received this item because i do not receive a good signal very well upstairs in the master bedroom   i m not sure why other reviewers have a hard time understanding how to install this  it has very clear instructions in amanual you receive   hit a couple buttons put in your wps code then you take it and put it in the room you want  so simple  works very well for me      
351,4.0 ,                       package is easy   instructions are easy  for simple normal setup   i got this model b c i m looking to hide my ssid for extra security   the setek extender i ordered before could not be configured as such  note setek refunded me      of my purchase plus tax for this trouble   and i didn t have to return the unit   so i looked up the instructions for netgear before ordering  determining how to configure it with hidden ssid  feeding off my hidden ssid  and all using wpa    with such a config  i can t just hit the wps button   my hidden ssid on my main router invalidates that option   i use firefox as my std  browser   first set up the extender using firefox   i can use it to find my hidden ssid router  and it picks up and extends the signal   great   now to configure the repeater so it s hidden   followed the instructions  hit a dead end a few times   repeated several times   reset to factory settings once to start over   not sure what s going on   set up the link to the main router again   opened up the config page with ms edge instead   i think it took   times  and then finally got to the page to hide the ssid for the the repeater   phew   total time  maybe an hour and some stress now  so far so good   it s been on nonstop for over a week  and fills in the wifi hole in the house in both floors   runs a little warm  but all the lights are green and no drop in signal   form factor is nice b c i can plug into the lower socket  and the upper is still accessible   stars for the hardware     stars for the flexibility options in configuration     stars for the erratic behavior of the setup page  and getting to the options i want  and consistency against the online instructions   hopefully i won t have to touch it again for a while      
352,3.0 ,                       the ex     wifi range extender is the first product from netgear i m not enthusiastic about  it works  but it works perhaps too well  it handles both the     and   ghz channels  but does so individually  and if your device links to it rather than your regular internet gateway  it doesn t switch between channels seamlessly  you have to do it manually  and wifi speed is significantly slower through this device compared to my gateway s speed  in addition  i can be in the same room with my gateway  and my iphone or even my imac will arbitrarily switch over to the netgear booster  even though it s    feet farther away than the wireless cable modem next to my desk  this thing definitely has range going for it  but it tries to simply take over my devices when it s unneeded  and definitely unwanted when i need all the speed i can get  but hey  for the cost  it s okay      
353,5.0 ,                       the netgear range extender works great for me  my modem is in living room downstairs and my office is upstairs  i used to have to run a cable down the stairs to the living room  but now the cable s gone and i have a good clear signal to my office without the wire to trip over  great deal for a great device  and  with the fantastic amazon service      
354,5.0 ,                       i could not use this unit   i followed instructions and all the lites turned on and blinked as described  that is as far as it went even though my router wps lite  was on and blinked   it would not pair i tried to call netgear but no phone available until the unit was registered   i registered at the netgear site which informed me that registration was complete but they could not register the product  they gave me no explanation   i had no further support  and no phone number to call   the unit is being returned i did not return contrary to my previous statement  my unit did get registered  after searching a bit on the bottom of the page was the support selection which appeared only after the unit was registered   i chose chat line for help   they were very helpful   they spent much time with me because i was a slow learner  with much patience  and i am sure a great deal of restraint  they helped me step by step to set up my unit   looking back  it was a very easy process to follow   it should be no big deal for anyone with even the slightest bit of technical wifi knowledge to set up in about   or   minutes   obviously   i rate this   stars and not the   star i gave originally      
355,5.0 ,                       just plugged this in near my gateway and pressed the wps on both for a wifi extender  then i read that the netgear ex     can be used as a wifi hot spot  so using a powerline adapter with ethernet cable from the adapter to the extender i set up the access point using the ip address found on the router browser page i opened the  netgear genie  for the ex     and set the adapter as access point  working well  just make sure you have the correct password for the extender  i now have   bar signal    feet away and   floor up from the gateway instead of   bars before using the ex     great price when i ordered      
356,4.0 ,                       i was really annoyed at first  lights on front showed device had not connected  tried manual way  page that was said to have connect button had no such thing  link to apple did not function  finally sought out youtube video on setup  in following those steps  i found by accident that the device had indeed connected and showed up in my macbook wifi listings  clicked  put in my usual password  and it worked like a dream  so if at first you fail  don t give up  check wifi networks  visit youtube  it really does function   and so far it s working pretty well      
357,5.0 ,                       super easy setup  true push button simplicity  and bingo  my reception problems were solved  extended coverage exactly as promised in the manufacturer s illustration on amazon page   before installation  my regular wifi router s signal could not get past my central chimney  so the front of my house had great wifi but the back half was weak  and the back corner had none  a central chimney perfectly blocked it    with the netgear ac    mounted in the center of the house  in a location not blocked by the chimney  but just beyond it  it accepts my  old  signal  which travels through a few thin walls to the extender s location  and then bathes the whole house  and back yard  with a new dual band signal   it is particularly nice to have the  ghz signal because it is a much less congested band  most neighbors are gumming up the works in the  ghz bands      
358,5.0 ,                       i live in a remote area where i have limited internet access  the wireless router i use just didn t keep a connection in the opposite end of the house where my computer is located  in desperation i ordered this extender and plugged it into an outlet in the computer room and the problem was solved  i recommend this extender  and i also recommend to anyone buying one that they read other reviews that go into detail on how to set it up  it is really easy to set up  but as others have commented  you need to use a tablet instead of a desktop computer to do it and the directions that come with the unit aren t totally clear on that      
359,1.0 ,                       the absolute worst customer service i ve ever experienced in over    years   not only was he not helpful  and couldn t figure out what was wrong  but after i told him i would not give him  nor anyone else i did not know  access to remote into my computer  he got angry and told me that i shouldn t have called him  and was a bother to him and used profanity   thanks for nothing netgear    won t buy your brand ever again      
360,4.0 ,                       once installed this worked great  i bought it for my mother who is     she is still pretty tech savvy for     she could not get it too connect she called netgear who told her unless she bought a     dollar firewall it was never going to connect because she had a bunch of unknown ip addresses on her computer   well yes she did and that is now taken care of   however the extender connects to the router not the computer so this was a blatant attempt to have her pay for something she did not need in order to make this product work  when she told them she could not buy the netgear version she was told then she needed to go to best buy and get something or it was never going to work   it literally took less than   minutes for the cox service rep to walk her through pushing the button on her router to make it work   i would have returned this she didn t want to mess with doing a return       
361,5.0 ,                       so overall  i give this netgear ac    wifi range extender   stars for doing a solid job extending my home wifi to my farthest room  maintaining solid speed and providing a full   bars of wireless connectivity  all at a low price here s some feedback on a few key areas size quality    very small  plugs into the bottom plug in a   plug  standard outlet and leaves room to plug in another item above it  no problem    material quality seems to be quite good  nice materials  clear lettering labeling  buttons have a good tactile feel to them   don t forget to peel off the thin  transparent film over the front panel setup    a bit  glitchy       options for setup  wps mode  the  easier  one  and with web browser setup   i tried wps mode and despite following directions  the unit would not establish a connection with the router   so  as directions state  i tried the  connect with web browser  mode   this seemed to go ok  but in a couple spots  it seemed to glitch a bit when following directions  but after some  extra  time     min    i skipped one of the steps and it was able to complete the setup   i was able to connect to both the    ghz and  ghz bands  as my verizon fios router supported it    this is good especially regarding speed  below  speed performance    so overall very pleased with this area    there s an upstairs room in my house that s farthest from the router  and wireless can vary there from very occasionally a full   bars  to occasionally   bars  to typically   or   bars  to sometimes   bar  to occasionally   bars   your ipad is not connected to the internet     ugh    here are the results i saw  based on speedtest net average of   tests per setup    original optimum wireless  ipad   ft from router     ping    ms  download      mbps  upload      mbps  original wireless in farthest location in house    ping     ms  download     mbps  upload     mbps  ac    extender    ghz band in farthest location    ping     ms  download      mbps  upload      mbps  full   bars wireless strength   ac    extender  ghz band in farthest location    ping     ms  download      mbps  upload      mbps  full   bars wireless strength so you can see that the ac    extender significantly improved download speeds  vs  original wireless   nearly  x for the  ghz band  and doubled the upload speed  all compared to performance in the same physical location at the farthest spot from the router    just as important  the wireless strength was a full   bars with the extender  whereas my original wireless is quite weak there and occasionally drops completely   your ipad is not connected to the internet     hate that   i would definitely recommend this product and purchase again  especially considering the performance for the inexpensive price      
362,1.0 ,                       i opened the unit and plugged it in where the modem is  i pressed the button  wps  on the extender and then did the same to the modem  i switch the location to where i was having trouble and plugged it in there   i waiting sometime and with my wifi meter i saw it was at        then i unplugged it and no difference    i said  no  and i tried it again   no change  i sent it back  i ordered another one from another outfit and if this does not work i give up      
363,2.0 ,                       it has a very easy to use interface  but it doesn t always work  and  it wont give you any error message when it fails  so  if it seems to setup ok  but doesn t work  just try again  it is a little bit annoying that there is no error message  but at least you can still get it to work  maybe a quarter star penalty the  ghz band works well for me  but not the      anything that uses it is just slow  if i try their  fastlane   technology  then it is slow like      this technology is supposed to combine the two frequencies to make it faster than either  not slower  by slow  i mean ar least as slow as the router i am trying to extend  even though i am much closer to the extender   i wonder if something is wrong with the radio  if it is a rare issue  maybe half a star  if it is normal  then two stars so  i contact netgear support with my question  they immediately responded with silence  a couple weeks later they remain silent  so  i guess that i just have to return it  and hope the replacement is better another technical issue is that this extender changes the mac address of the client  this screws up the dhcp server of my fancy firewall router  my previous ancient router flashed with dd wrt  and set up to be a repeater did better than this thing at    ghz i guess that the positives are small  not ugly and cheap  at least it sort of works for  ghz  nonexistent support update  i returned it and got another one  it worked better  i finally got the fastlane technology to work well  however  it started disconnecting  after some homework and testing  i figured out that it does not work on all channels of  ghz  when my main router switched to one of these channels  the netgerlar extender        could no longer see the router  so  now i have to manually set my router channel  and hope that the environment does not get crowded around it      
364,2.0 ,                       the range extender ultimately gets   stars instead of   because it did increase the range my wifi would go  however  it frequently drops connections causing me to have to reboot or reconnect to the internet  this get extremely frustrating after then  nd or  rd time in an hour there is also a note able slow down in mbps when connecting to the extended wifi unfortunately this did not solve my problems and i will have to purchase another option soon enough      
365,1.0 ,                       bought this to get a little more range into my front yard  i read into this before buying so i knew what it does and doesn t  it works like a repeater  it will only put out what it is taking in  so if it gets poor connection in  it ll extend a poor connection out  i knew that already  and it works good actually as far as extending the available range i already have  my problem is  it keeps disconnecting and i have to turn it off every few days and reboot it and re set it up every few days  really irritating  the reason i bought it was to extend range to the front yard so i can connect my wireless surveillance to my base station  it works great and gets reception out in the front yard now  so my camera works  but the problem is when this  extender  fails every few days  so does my surveillance because the base is connected to the extender  so when extender fails  my cameras don t record  that s not good for my home security system as my family and i rely on those cameras to work all the time to monitor our property  looks like i am past the return period too  oh well  a worthless paper weight now  time to look for something better      
366,5.0 ,                       very easy to set up    took less than   minutes   my smart tv had been at the fringe of my    ghz coverage zone and beyond my  ghz coverage zone   now solid signals for both from my new extended networks  my tv uses the    ghz extended network and my roku uses the  ghz extended network  with absolutely no problems  ie  no stops for buffering     previously  the tv and roku were using the    ghz network and stopped to buffer once every       min    i have     mbps internet service   when i do speed tests on  the new  ghz extended network  it is typically    mbps  or about half of what my  ghz network provides    just as advertised   my new    ghz extended network provides about    mbps  only slightly less than the   mbps that my    ghz original network provides   plenty for all of the streaming services   i am a happy camper      
367,3.0 ,i know the drill   i can t get wifi in my bed room    my garage doesn t have a signal    the router is in the basement   this little device will merely do half the job it s supposed to  now if you re looking for an actual fix  i would suggest a mesh router system  i will explain why   extender  the one you re looking at   pros  cheap simple set up  usually just a   button set up  kind of works cons  will act as another device on network this will take up massive amounts of bandwidth and slow down your network  is a bit of an eye sore does not usually extend a strong signal  the  ghz never worked on my device   even knowing i set it up correctly  you may be connected only to your network or this extender  one must manually switch between   mesh wifi  pros  extends signal more stylish designs  can look like a lamp  ern  vase  etc   reconnects devices to other routers on a whim able to prioritize traffic and avoid too many devices on one able to route super strong signals able to route both   and     very well between each unit same username password to connect to all usually has an app to help set up set up takes about   minutes  same as extender  cons  a little pricier can occasionally come with more units than you need   i stand by my rockspace mesh routers  as of now i have set   families and a business up with them  they love them  regularly around       but sometimes can be snagged for      for a deal on amazon  i have no affiliation with them  i m sure google  eero  or lynksys has great ones too  but not for a deal like that  anyways  look more into it if you don t believe me  it will future proof you  have a good day 
368,5.0 ,                       pretty easy to set up  the written instructions were not applicable for my router but the online set up tool worked like a charm   no real issues  took me about    minutes to figure everything out and get it up and running  now that i have it set up  it s working great  this device repeats both my     ghz and   ghz bands successfully and i was able to get my connection speeds up in my work nook up to     mbps  up from    mbps  by plugging in this device about halfway between my nook and my wifi router   and that s pretty much all i bought this thing to do  so i m quite happy with this purchase      
369,4.0 ,                       bought this for an outdoor building  it s about    feet from the router  i have to beg the internet to reach  maybe it s because the building is metal  had a google extension in the building before and had no problem  got rid of the google because i had it on a surge protector and it still kept breaking after a lightning storm  hopefully this one can last during bad weather  it works but it takes a while to get on line      
370,4.0 ,                       it did work for me mostly but ended up returning for the stronger tplink model  i originally had it broadcasting both  g and     but airplay would not work correctly  so i put it in  g mode only which improved things  i would get about   mbps  out of my    mbps connection   at the back of the house where before i couldn t see the router at all  i returned it because when browsing sites like facebook or reddit  my phone would get stuck each time it tried to load a video  i ended up getting the      model from tplink and now get   mbps and dont have any issues  im sure the stronger netgear model would be similar but it was     more      
371,1.0 ,                       this extender was defective  i wasn t able to connect after many attempts of resetting  etc  and then tech support was all suspicious trying to say that i had foreign accounts on my ip address and tried to convince me it was why it didn t work  they wanted me to pay     for support to solve that issue  i went to the store and bought one off the shelf and it worked immediately      
372,4.0 ,                       it s a good quality unit   i just had a problem with placement and reach   but overall it s a good product but you must remember it will not extend your coverage but set up a secondary extension to your  network name   ext  that you will have to relink all your devices to to get a better signal   overall it s worth the price and the trouble of setting up which was not that difficult at all just a few button presses to link   however you have to log into it after you clone your existing network to run a wizard app etc etc      
373,1.0 ,                       completely and in all ways a total waste of money   i ve seen not one bit of difference from before having an extender to wasting my money on this one   the range is still around    feet   what it was prior to hooking it up   i have four green lights  so it s definitely hooked up properly   which also was a challenge as the website it suggests for assistance doesn t exist   i ve had terrible luck with every item i ve ever purchased that says netgear on it   i don t have any idea why i thought this would be any different      
374,1.0 ,                       don t buy this  it s worthless   i have no idea how so many reviews are positive i bought this to extend the signal for my wireless security cameras   it was ridiculous to install  and i m pretty good with those kinds of things   the instructions are terrible and no online support   then after spending way too much time to install   it literally made our signal worse i m not one to publicly bash a product  but i was extremely disappointed with this item   please do your homework prior to buying something      
375,4.0 ,                       with the setup instructions it is a easy   minutes to install the one thing do not do  under any circumstances is use tech support  they program the unit not to work  then offer you a      plan to fix the problem this is how it happened  i used netgear instructions on line  chat window opens up would you like help  said yes  after a couple of questions  she stated a tech would help  he called me took over my pc  after    minutes  could not get unit to work  put me on hold then sales pitch about it is my internet network is the problem   and for      can fix it  told him no  exchanged my unit with amazon  installed it in   minutes  shame on netgear for using a  rd party service company     
376,2.0 ,                       instructions were clear and it was easy to get this extender up and running quickly  however    the devices using the extender would disconnect often and the only way to get them connected again was to turn the extender off and on again  i also updated the firmware but the problem persisted  can t say i would recommend this extender      
377,5.0 ,                       this is the best range extender so far  i wasn t sure about it  but it was recommended by the xfinity technician and i just decided to give it a try  it works great  i bought it primarily for my smart tv  there was no way for me to connect tv directly to my router because it is more necessary to have direct connection to my computer  so i obviously was in need to range extender for my tv  netgear range extender is the answer  i had another one before  securify almond  and it didn t work good   slow connectivity  sometimes it would not connect at all or it would drop the connection in the middle  it was frustrating to say the least  i don t watch tv often  but when i watch it i want it to work  obviously   now it works with this small thing perfectly  so i am very very pleased with this purchase      
378,2.0 ,                       i wanted to boost my home wifi and thought this would be perfect  it doesn t actually extend your original wifi signal  but rather uses that signal to make a new wifi  so instead of boosting the signal to back part of the house  i would have to connect to a different wifi when back there as opposed to rest of house  not what i wanted  but placed it in back of house and hooked alexa to it and now i don t have a dropped signal for her back there  worked out for me  but not what i wanted or hoped for when i purchased     
379,1.0 ,                       i purchased a second netgear wifi extender since the first one seemed great   i followed the netgear instructions precisely and the  nd one would not setup but it also broke the  st one that had worked great     now i am stuck with two netgear extenders and neither of them work   cannot return the  st purchase because that window has closed but the  nd one is going back to amazon   very disappointed to say the least      
380,5.0 ,                       due to the coronavirus i am on mandatory telework  i m an engineer  i was sent home with my big linux workstation that had no wifi card  only ethernet  for connectivity  but the only place i could put it in my house was far away from my home s network router  i followed the instructions to set up the wifi  basic and  g signals  just as the video on the product page showed using the wps buttons on my router and the extender  the only difference is it took a little longer for the device to boot up than the video led me to believe  once it was ready  everything went smoothly  i plugged the extender into an outlet near my computer  powered it on and connected an ethernet cord to my workstation  the workstation was already configured for dhcp  so no changes were necessary  using this extender was completely transparent to my linux os and i needed no administrator privileges to get online   if the ethernet port wasn t configured for dhcp  i think i would have needed either admin privileges on linux or a non default configuration for the extender  i haven t noticed any speed problems  but i m connecting to work over a very strained vpn to which i currently attribute most of the lag when it occurs      
381,5.0 ,                       wow     just wow     i gotta say this is one solid device overall  it s very small and i m just amazed at how well it performs  i love that it doubles as both a wireless router and a hardware connection  the best part is it can use the  ghz broadband that my modem has  love the speeds i don t lose any speed at all and it connects flawlessly to my main modem  in my room which has quite a few walls before reaching my main modem i only get about     bars and sometimes while streaming it ll just go back to my lte service without warning and it starts using my phones data  i hated that  and here s an idea of how far my room is from my modem  i have to go through the laundry room past the garage door  to the kitchen and through the kitchen is the dineing room and past that is the living room where the modem is  so yea it s quite aways away lol  however this device had no problem hooking up with the wps button  and upon doing it a second time i connected to the  ghz for way better speeds  now as we know     vs  ghz speed there is a significant difference in how fast data is transferred  however at the cost of length  you ll get better speeds meaning to take advantage of the  ghz speed you ll have to be closer to the modem  as opposed to     where you can be farther but get less speed  this isn t an issue with this nifty device as it can be moved virtually anywhere there is an outlet  i considered my room a dead zone as i couldn t get good signal i ended up running a    ft car cable to an external wireless router just to get wifi in my room but it was unrealizable because of its own gateways and settings that prevented the services to work correctly  however with this wall adapater it mimicked my main modems settings including password  so it s like me being in the living room by my modem       i was lucky enough to get this product when it was on sale  i would definitely pay full price for it if i had to for this kind of reliability      
382,1.0 ,                       this type of review is necessary for future consumers who are thinking of buying this product  the extender manual that comes in the package makes no sense  it feels like it is strategically done this way so the costumer has to contact their live support  you then receive a call back with in a few minutes          a rep with a heavy  indian accent then calls you and tries to help you by downloading a program called splash top   which allows him her to control your desktop  long story short  they in no way  shape or form intended to help us  the started a fear campaign by telling us  how vulnerable our system was  how one of our  g networks needed to be protected and how they would be able to help us if we paid          not once was our set up problem addressed  luckily  we did not fall for the  protection scheme   but after our call we did google the company and saw dozens of reviews about people getting scammed into paying for things they did not need  beware   netgear shame on you for hiring a  rd party technical support that is scamming consumers      
383,3.0 ,                       needed to extend wifi to reach outdoor cameras   just beside a window unable to get more then   bars signal at blink camera   ft away  setup is annoying as you have to use their app   even new routers are being shipped that way  very much a headache for those who are use to just logging in and making changes they need quickly      
384,5.0 ,                       mi vida resuelta para tener internet en las habitaciones del  do piso  vivo en una casa de dos niveles     m  de construcci n por nivel y no llegaba la se al del internet en el  do piso  ahora hay se al wifi en todas partes  incluso cuando salgo fuera y  al balc n que es muy grande      
385,1.0 ,                       initially worked fairly well at extending signal to our kitchen  but not great   a few months ago we found that at times  we would have to switch devices to the main router because the signal from the extender would get  lost    this week  after    months  it completely quit   no signal  no lights  and when went to unplug it  it was very hot   my greatest happiness is that i discovered the problem before it caused a fire      
386,5.0 ,                       needed to extend my wifi so it reached my generator  which is installed behind my unattached garage bought a   piece extender from centurylink  my provider  for        it was worthless sent it back and bought this one   it works perfectly   modem in house  extender in the garage about     away from modem  and generator on the outside about     away from the extender      
387,2.0 ,                       while this is easy to install  it s all downhill from there for this kind of product  i suppose that your mileage will vary greatly based on where you plan to use it  i was hoping to get it to cover a   bedroom apartment  the router is on one end  and the wifi just didn t reach to the other side  so i put it somewhere that consistently has good signal  now  sitting on the other side of the apartment  yes  my devices clearly are connected to the network this device creates  but the connection is incredibly  unbearably slow and inconsistent  forget any sort of streaming  even basic websites can be a struggle occasionally it will decide that it does want to do its job  and then for a second all is well  but it will soon go back to its normal speeds  or better yet  the extended network disappears entirely for a while  or devices connected to it will claim there is no internet access  how this can happen when the device is plugged in in a place with perfect connection is beyond me seriously disappointed  unless i discover there s a solid piece of lead in the walls that would justify this poor performance  i can t recommend it      
388,4.0 ,                       i bought this because my wifi reception in the backyard was bad  my modem is too far away   the netgear is plugged in midway from the modem to the backyard  whenever it works it s exactly what i need to have strong wifi in my backyard  my phone   ipad recognize the signal without me having to manually change it from the modem to the netgear however  as i keep saying  it doesn t always work unfortunately  i find myself constantly unplugging than plugging back in  which usually solves the issue   all is good  however  i feel that i have to do this more often than not  gets kinda annoying i know  i know  major first world problems  but if i pay nearly     for a product  it should work most of the time   jussayin     
389,5.0 ,                       setup offered two approaches  a wps automated one  and manual setup using a browser  the wps approach  sounded very easy  did not work with my comcast xfinity modem router  which i could believe was the problem   however  the manual setup worked very well and the extender was up and running in a few minutes  that was a couple months ago and it s been working very well ever since      
390,1.0 ,                       this device installed easily but constantly disconnects   im using this with an arris pace     ac vdsl router modem and have never had any issue connecting directly to it either at    ghz or  ghz when in range  the disconnect problem occurred even when the extender was in the same room as the modem router  there are numerous posts on the internet regarding this issue with this product  i m a systems administrator and experienced with troubleshooting these issues but could not resolve this one    getting returned  asap        
391,5.0 ,                       does exactly what i need it to do  placed properly with respect to your main router and where you need stronger signal  the netgear works very well  i use it mainly to connect a couple security cameras and my irrigation system  however  it the the default wifi signal in our master bedroom so we use it on our phones often and i have noticed no lag in normal use on my phone  i e  email  instagram  facebook  web browsing  etc  and while i rarely stream video on my phone  i have no doubt that it could handle this as well  for signal strength  i put the netgear in    ghz mode rather than dual band as it has a slightly better range and still provides ample speed  i average about     mbps in my bed coupled with     mbps service  would definitely recommend     
392,5.0 ,                       i added this my basement to get a signal for the tv there  my grandsons attached their xbox to the tv while visiting so they could play fortnite  the signal was plenty strong and they had no issues playing the game  in fact  they told me that the signal was better than in their home  for the price  it seems to be an excellent piece of technology      
393,1.0 ,                       this is supposed to be easy to set up  right   not   i suspect everyone has trouble as the help line is in bold print on the installation page   after talking to someone on another continent for an hour and paying       the devise was finally operable   i would not get this product unless you were well versed in the way devices connect with each other      
394,1.0 ,                       this product is advertised as working with all wifi systems   not so much   i use a mac and an airport extreme as a router off a dumb cable modem   i went through all the steps to set up the unit as indicated by the netgear website   i had to call support to get assistance   i was assisted by a gentleman with a very thick indian accent  whom i could barely understand   in short  i had to set up a second wifi network and tie it to my ipad   problem is  it wouldn t keep connected and if i closed the cover of the ipad  it shut off   this thing will put out a super strong signal and probably works best with a windows setup   i returned the item   it might work well for you in windows setups  but definitely not a mac      
395,5.0 ,                       this is a     extender  and i think some of the reviewers are expecting too much from it  we moved into a larger house and the router that came with our fiber internet wasn t good enough for a strong signal in the bedrooms  so before spending hundreds on a mesh system we decided to try this extender first  and it does the trick just fine set up is somewhat time consuming but not hard if you follow the directions  i learned to wait a minute or two after each step because sometimes it took that long for the right lights to show up  i set up  g and  g and they both work fine if you re a gamer this may not be powerful enough  but we can stream movies and video chat in the bedroom through this extender  so we re happy with it      
396,4.0 ,                       great price point period  once setup was complete       hours later  it was okay  tech support was great  with some assistance our wifi did boost but was not very good  again  technical support to the rescue  once we moved it to a different location in the house it worked better even yet      
397,5.0 ,                       i bought this extender because my vizio smart tv kept dropping signal while running netflix   i decided on the dual band model because i m computer illiterate and didn t do any research before hand   turns out  if you don t have a dual band router you don t need a dual band extender regardless of what the advertisement says about the speed differences of the extender itself   the    g model would have worked just fine   you live  you learn    i bought new and not refurbished so it came well packaged and with an easy to follow instruction book    after initial plug in the power light turned amber and took approx      sec to turn green   be patient  it is working    setup was very simple  just follow the directions   if you have a password on your current wifi router  but no physical wpa button on the device then you will need your router s web based setup ip so you can connect the extender    i ve been watching netflix on my television for the past    minutes uninterrupted by signal drops   i can t believe i didn t buy this sooner      
398,2.0 ,                       i bought   of these to cover a somewhat sprawling one story house  one was new and the other refurbished first the refurbished one came without any documentation and had not been reset thus contained previous owner s information   factory reset is pretty easy if you know how to do it but happy i had setup manual that came with the new one set it up with a t p router and followed net gear setup instructions  both time using wps was at first a failure  manual said push wps button on extender the push wps button on router  never seemed to work  did it backwards by pushing the wps button on the router first and it then connected with proper credentials access to the unit is only through the net gear genie and ended up having to create two accounts  one for each extender  even though i had turned the first one off while setting up the second one once talking to the router i needed to update the firmware on the extender  that took a few minutes but occurred automatically with the net gear setup genie at first throughput was very poor at less than    mbps with router delivering     mbps  since i was not getting over     mbps speeds from the router i switched the extender from auto to fast lane settings  had extender communicate   ghz with router and      ghz with clients  voila  then getting       mbps at connected clients which is plenty for my needs so i would suggest   power up extender very close to the router    you can connect wps but try both extender first  as manual says  and if the does not work try router wps button first   if you can get by with less than     mbps at your wireless client i would suggest using fast lane settings rather than auto     switching  for whatever reason my speed increase about    x in the fast lane mode even though i was connecting at     rather than   ghz frequency  if you need speeds above     mbps direct wired or wireless connection to the router probably is best edit  dropping the review down to   stars because of difficulty in accessing the unit by browser when it exhibited erratic behavior  only solution was to do factory reset and then go through the rather complex setup procedure again  i am returning the unit for a different model      
399,5.0 ,                       i bought this to extend my parents home wifi to better reach tv s  phones  laptops on the other end of the house setup was quick and easy  used my phone to connect to the extender and had it setup in a few minutes   it can broadcast   networks      and   ghz so if your router does both it will extend both  it gives you the option to use the existing network names with  ext appended to the names and can even automatically assign the existing network passwords to the new exntension networks after connecting them really quick  easy  and painless to use   so far the connection strength has been improved vs the distance to the router and streaming devices are now working consistently with no buffering issues      
400,2.0 ,                       bought this to extend my wifi signal to the back of my house  bought this because of good reviews  there are a few good things  namely  the user manual that came with this is really good and clear  also  the web based setup for this is also really good  very easy to setup  when it works  it works well  these are the only reasons i gave it   stars instead of   now  the bad part  worked for about    hours when first setup  seemed great  then  it just died  no internet at all  had to unplug and plug it back in to get it working again  then it worked for a couple more hours before losing internet again  unplugged it again  plugged it back in  got it working  worked for a few hours more   then died again    strikes and you are out  i will be returning this item i am a tech pro by trade so know how these things work  important to give them a unique ssid different from your main router  as most devices are not smart enough to automatically pick the strongest signal  i was sure i was always connected to the extender  also  the extender was located half way between my router and the back of my house   so it had a good signal  all lights were green  unfortunately  these kinds of problems of dropping internet happen more often than not with these low budget extenders all in all  well documented and easy to use  but subject to connection dropouts  not worth the hassle of having to unplug replug it every time it dies      
401,2.0 ,                       when this wouldn t connect to my router i called netgear tech support i allowed the technician control over my brand new macbook pro to fix the issue  he brought up a scene that purported to show that there were multiple ip addresses in my system  and that the cause was a trojan  he showed the firewall as being down  he offerred to fix it at     s per hour  he said my other devices on the same network would be affected  i ve since been told my   other apple techs that this wouldn t be possible even if there was a trojan virus i took the laptop to my local apple certified tech support  and they ran a full check showing no infiltration  the firewall is in place and has remained so for several weeks i don t know if this is netgear s in house support or it s farmed out but this excursion cost me      for my local guy to investigate and negate what was said  an expensive journey i d be interested to know of anyone else with similar experience      
402,4.0 ,                       updatei was so disappointed with the performance of this extender that i temporarily forgot why i originally bought it  i read an article about drops in bandwidth of routers causing excessive buffering and drops when putting more demand on it  supposedly that could all be magically fixed with an extender  the one recommended was only    ghz and i wanted one that was also  ghz  i chose this one and for that it has been perfect  i went from having buffering issues a couple dozen times a day to zero times  i even run speed tests on my phone which used to immediately cause buffering issues and there s no effect   i m changing my rating from   star to   with the proviso that it not be bought to actually extend your network but to fix router bandwidth issues i got this specifically to give me greater range with my existing ssid  hence  extender   what they don t tell you is you must use a different ssid for the extender  defeating its whole purpose  that makes it another access point  as if that s not enough  i tested the speed from my normal router      mbps versus the speed from the extender     mbps  where i place it had no effect  i tried changing the ssid to the same as my router but that locked me out of the extender since my phone wouldn t connect to the extender because of its low bandwidth  avoid this      
403,2.0 ,                       our house has our router situated on an outside wall pretty much at the corner of the house  we put this extended at about the center of our house to try to extend the wifi to the other corner of the house and the internet was awful  almost as if we did nothing  but since we could connect to it  it just gave us very slow internet  our internet is normally amazing if your near our original router     down and    up is average if not on our slower side  and from when i could get    down and    up in the room beside us  connecting to the extended in the same spot  i only get    down and   up  the room i needed it in doesn t even show up  if you re looking to get a cheap extended  get something else if you don t want to drop your internet speed for just a little bit of extension      
404,5.0 ,                       works great   the internet box is in my office off of my room  my kids rooms are on the other side of the house  they were in a dead zone and not getting a good connection and sometimes no connection at all  plugged this in the living room near their rooms and they have zero trouble now  someone else said  and it s important  don t put it in the dead zone or it won t pick up internet either  needs to be near the area you need help in      
405,1.0 ,                       unfortunately  this never worked properly to extend the wifi signal to my daughters bedroom  she would pick up a signal maybe     of the time    but then she would always lose the signal in the middle of doing whatever she was doing on her laptop  ipad and or iphone  my husband changed the location of it multiple times but it never helped  we ended up throwing it out yesterday because it was useless   perhaps we got a lemon i don t know    but i would not recommend this based on our experience        
406,3.0 ,                       wifi extender has it s pros and cons  we needed to cover furthest room in the house and provide better wifi for the backyard  the goal was achieved but i have strong feeling that this is temporary solution  definite pro   the cost  connection with the router is   out of    speed provided by    ghz network is      speed on  ghz bandwidth        devices connected to the extender don t switch automatically to more powerful main network as you move form one area to another  i m wondering if there is a way to make devices switch between networks intelligently the bottom line   we are getting what we paid for  strong   out or        
407,5.0 ,                       this solved my weak signal trouble we have an overly large house an though we have a good router it just was not getting through a foof line  a ceiling and   walls to the far side of the house from our attic room this little gem solved our problem in about    minutes set up is super simple   i hit the wps button on the extender then the button on the router in about    seconds it had synced up the    g signal   i then repeated the process for the  g signal after that i just picked a room half way across the house  plugged in the extender and in about    seconds it was up and running logging in was simple   the extender shows up as the same network name you already have with ext at the end and you use the same password the entire process took maybe    minutes our fire stick and other devices went from little or no signal to about     sugnal      
408,5.0 ,                       got this as my samsung smart tv had the wifi card go completely bad  one month after my   year warranty at bestbuy was up  this is paired to my wireless router and then plugged in by the tv at the other end of the house  it has an ethernet outlet and that plugs into the tv lan port  i get my netflix up and running faster than i ever have  i think the wifi card was not working properly since i bought the tv new in      as it was always slow and about once a week would not work  i thought it was my router but this device proved that wrong  works perfectly      
409,1.0 ,                       either this extender is impossibly difficult to install  or it arrived dead on arrival  i ll give it the benefit of the doubt and go with doa  returned for refund  trying the tp link ac     next at the same price point      
410,1.0 ,                       after about   months of light use  the    g channel has stopped working on all devices   g works fine    i called netgear technical support and they only offer complimentary support on this product for    days  after which they want you to pay for support   i researched this issue online and found several posts with the same problem   i have done a factory reset  firmware update and confirmed the settings are correct   netgear does offer a   year warranty but they require a return authorization number  which can only be obtained through technical support  which requires a paid subscription   this doesn t seem ethical   i would avoid this product and given the warranty technical support catch     i will certainly be considering other manufacturers for future purchases      
411,5.0 ,                       my main reason for getting this was due to a weak signal for my ring door bell   i also had very weak signal in one of our bedrooms  but i had procrastinated on that one for years   i have an apple       ac router located in my office in the far corner of my house and it can t easily be relocated  so after reading reviews i decided to give this a try   i should note that i am a cisco certified network engineer for     years  so i considered a lot of different options  many of which would have driven my wife crazy you definitely need to let the wizard create the new ssids as you will run into issues trying to reuse the same one as your main router  i joined it to my wireless network and it created two additional ssids  myname  gext  and myname  gext    i joined the ring to the new ssid and took each of our mobile devices into the  dead zone  bedroom and joined them to the new ssids as well   the signal strength is now excellent throughout all of these areas   we just have to make sure we ve joined the new ssid when in that one bedroom   that s not a deal breaker for me   for geeks like me  rssi dropped from     to     at my furthest corner the price of extending the network is losing a bit more than half the speed  but i knew this coming into the project   if you manage those expectations  you will be happy also   i normally get       mbps downloads on my main ssid   using this extender  it drops to       mbps   that s still plenty for streaming multiple netflix programs at the same time   it has the added benefit of essentially rate limiting anything that i put on the new ssids  meaning that any devices that use the extended network cannot use all of my available bandwidth   unbeknownst to my kids  their games and downloads will never again ruin a conference call i should touch on placement   you need to put this closer to your main router than to the area you re trying to cover   in my case it s only about     away from my router in the hallway   wireless signal strength is greatly affected by wood and even more so by glass and metal   i suggest placing this no more than   closed door or   interior wall away from your router if possible   when planning where to put it  pick the location that is most free from interference   most of my plugs are behind or under furniture  so that s why the hallway was chosen i would buy this again      
412,4.0 ,                       super easy to set up and connect to my netgear nighthawk router  the bedrooms upstairs on the opposite end of the house are a dead zone for my router  which is why i needed an extender  i placed the extender in the hallway and it works really well when it is connected  it drops the connection about once or twice a week  i have to power it down and back up  and it reconnects right away  i m not sure if disconnecting has something to do with where i plugged it in  or if there is a glitch in the unit itself  i haven t tried in a different outlet  because i don t really have any other outlets with a good line of sight to the affected bedrooms  when it is working  which is most of the time  it puts out a good solid signal  i haven t noticed any measurable speed loss  i get a better signal from the extender out in the garage than i do from my router      
413,5.0 ,                       this is way cheaper than buying the google or orbi systems  and can work as well depending on your needs  i live in a split level ranch that my router can t cover  and placing this extender strategically has allowed me to have excellent wifi all over the house  it s very easy to set up and easy to edit once setup on any browser      
414,2.0 ,                       it s was a big pain to get it to work and any time it stops working it s a pain to go through the process again  now it s like having no wifi  every  mins and our videos lag for  mins then play for   sec then lag again  we though it was our internet company but we just got a newer model and it works perfectly fine inside but not when we use it with the extender  we re in the process of either buying a new extender or paying our company to move the box     
415,4.0 ,                       the netgear range extender provides  wifi range without high cost  it works well  however  the installation documentation is poor and my experience with netgear support was not very good although they were willing to help for my installation  the use of an iphone to accomplish the setup was very helpful  joining the router network was difficult but once completed  the extender has worked well  amazon posts that a lot of these units have been sold and installed without difficulty      
416,1.0 ,                       i have a lot of network experience   i owned an ex      and now bought this   it just arrived   here is what has happened so far     it would not  i mean would not go into wps mode   so i tried to do the setup with my pc browser   wrong   despite hooking to its  wifi  it would not allow me in thru their  mywifiext net  url   i finally got it to connect thru wps by unplugging it and plugging it back in and leaving it for a while before pressing wps     it created the extension network sids   but  not the same names as the ex      so i still had to get into it to change the sid  which would be easier than changing all the iot devices already using that old sid   well  i still cannot get the  mywifiext net  url to work from my pc   period   tried turning off my antivirus  my firewalls  everything   nope   so i was able to get into it from my tablet s browser   but then it would not work properly to accept any character input from that browser page   eventually  i tried firefox  chrome  edge and brave browsers on my pc  but found that the opera browser would connect this is a huge issue and a quick web search shows hundreds or thousands of people having the exact same issue   their one and only way to control it does not work         
417,4.0 ,                       connects fairly easy  was not able to get wps to link so i went to the net  fortunately  you do not have to be sitting next to your route  i purchased this for my studio which is a whole separate building  wifi at home was just not strong enough to go through block walls  that being said once i set up the account with netgear it was a snap to get set up  however finding a outlet that will allow the devise proper conditions i have resulted to keeping it in the middle of the studio  it only shows orange or red lights for the signal strength but i will get full bars and no lag there was a catch on set up so make sure to read the directions closely  there are   ways to set up one allows you to extend the range and another is for a  nd wifi connection perhaps for guests that you may not want on your line otherwise this is a solid purchase      
418,3.0 ,                       i m not an it expert  so i ll adhere to the kiss rule  keep it simple  stupid   no special skills are required to set it up   the wps buttons on the unit and the wireless router do most of the work   for electronic stuff  the instructions are pretty clear and easy to follow   i needed to extend the signal from the downstairs family room at t broadband router to the second floor where our desktop pc is located  and this extender does the job ok  but not great the unit creates two new channels  one on the     ghz band and the other on the  ghz   to use the signals  you have to add your devices to the  new  networks   the instructions identify them so that you can pick them out the others you ll pick up in your location   there is a  device  led on the extender that glows green when a device is using one of its channels i downloaded the netgear wifi analytics app on my android phone to check the signal strength   in our house  the signal was only marginally better  but usable   additional devices on the channel seemed to degrade the signal overall  the extender does the job  but in our house the improvement was marginal  at best   maybe a different model would have produced better results      
419,1.0 ,                       after persisting with online support and trying different device placements  none were more than   rooms away from the router   i could not get a reliable wireless signal from this unit  we had to follow the online browser based installation workflow  the simpler installation method did not work with our wireless router   and after various downloads and searching around netgear s support website  i just couldn t get the unit to work any better than what we had before  even when the wireless indicator showed  green    although it oftentimes turned orange or turned off altogether   in fact  my wireless connection dropped out far more often using the unit than when using the original wireless option   located in the basement  two floors and more than    feet away from my desk  the last thing i want to do is spend hours on the phone with tech support for something that should be so simple and straightforward  so i just packed it up and sent it back  i strongly suspect our problem is a function of the equipment and setup of our internet provider  charter   which seems to be different to other providers  and i wonder if it s just not possible for these devices to accommodate all the different standards and designs available  it s a shame  because i thought netgear was a reputable reliable brand and this product initially appeared to promise a simple and quick solution to our problem  in the past  i ve often been skeptical of highly negative reviews  especially when most reviews are stellar  as with this product  so i d strongly suggest giving this one a try  and if you have the time and patience to deal with online tech support  then good for you  but i m already burned out with it and tech issues right now  and don t have any more time for it      
420,5.0 ,                       easy install on wps and i am not a geek   router is a netgear nighthawk      so i  thought this would be more compatible than other brands   my house is only      sq feet so i was disappointed when the first location  on the same floor as the router  but in an opposite corner didn t work   relocated to the finished basement  selected a plug more in the middle of the house and it s working great   the real test will be to see if it holds up  and the reception stays in that area  barely had a bar before  now it s completely full   update   for the first time  my daughter said she had full bars  and it never cut out all night      
421,2.0 ,                       it is very easy to setup and works but performance is just not there  we just needed little extra       feet of coverage to reach to our back room we had to keep switching back to our router wifi and would get quicker responses than going through this extender  there seems to be a lag between this unit and our asus router so the signal boost is a false sense of connectivity  it might be good as a cheap wap but as an extender it was more frustrating than it is worth  also  it is not a mesh network so you have to remember to manually switch over to your  ssid ext   didn t try to mess with channels and naming the ssid the same our router  perhaps it would have worked since we did not want to run a cable for dedicated waps  and the whole point of this device  we just bought a newer stronger router all together   tp link ac      which was just enough of an upgrade without stepping into       range of a router      
422,5.0 ,                       the product was easy to set up initially  it works great extending my signal to the furthest points in my apartment  however when the cable company changed my equipment it took me hours to figure out how to reinstall  i set the equipment back to factory settings but it didn t help  the guide given with the equipment should have covered that subject      
423,3.0 ,                       this extends your wifi network by creating a new network  so if your network is mywifi you will then have to create at least     other networks for  g and  g respectively  so you will end up with your original mywifi network plus mywifi  g and mywifi  g or whatever you decide to name them  this is great for a stationary device like a desktop in another room or an appletv for example where you will set it to the new extended network and forget it  but with a device that is mobile like an iphone it does no good as that device will not choose the fastest wifi connection for you  so for example  in my bedroom which is far from the  mywifi  connection i connected my iphone to the  mywifi  g  network and had a good signal  however  when i went down into my basement where my wifi router is  my iphone was using lte as it was still on the  mywifi  g  extended network  i thought it would all be the same network  so this really doesn t help me  i guess i need a mesh wifi network  but those are expensive  otherwise  setup was a bit technical but not too bad  and overall this seems like a well built product  just know what you are getting first       
424,5.0 ,                       just what i needed to extend my range without moving my router  easy to install  and a perfect solution for streaming  it goes further than i thought it would  range is excellent and full speeds available  happy to have an easy solution for more range for internet in my yard  happy side effect was better coverage on second floor too      
425,5.0 ,                       i wish every product i buy works like this one  i have a ring doorbell and floodlight that were having issues with speed and connectivity  this extender solved that problem immediately  and continues to impress  i ve got lousy cell service where i live  and this product also allows me to use wifi calling well out into my yard  love it   i actually bought the ac     and the ac     planning to use the     to augment additional areas  but this     unit has taken care of the area so well  the     is still in the box      
426,2.0 ,                       my review is only on my personal experience with the product   it simply didn t work for me   i am sure it has worked for others   i have an old   story house and was trying to improve wifi in the first floor  the main router is in the second floor    set up was not tough  but you need to get a green light from the device in the  weaker  wifi area  and i was not getting it anywhere in the first floor  so it was useless for me   maybe it works better with newer homes and seems would be great in a ranch or single story home when trying to improve wifi from one end of the house to the next      
427,1.0 ,                       how can something as simple as a wifi extender be so problematic  the installation instructions were somewhat simple  it s the     device that s been poorly engineered  i d write something new if the bad reviews didn t already cover the multiple problems that i encountered  netgear tech support actually told me that i had a bad product so i replaced it with another ex      i m guessing i lost   hours between the   units  both units have now been returned      
428,3.0 ,                       i have a  small     sq  wood frame single floor basic florida retirement home   the signal strength in the master bedroom seemed weak with dropped call and buffering on my  nd generation fire stick   using    mbs spectrum internet only no cable   router is supplied  and is     and   ghz product comes with good installation instructions   ok  bottom line that is not spoken about in the product info is the after device  internet download speeds are cut in half approx   yes the speed is better in the bedroom but internet download speed is what is needed    ghz is only really good thru   wall   so if your provider internet speed varies good luck the amazon download has analiti speed testwifi analyzer  free    it will keep you informed of what is actually being delivered to each device however  dropped calls  are virtually gone any inside and outside around of the house      
429,5.0 ,                       i have to say  this little gem works beautifully  finally  something worked out  the way its supposed to i live in a low income apartment building  there are    units here  my apartment is on the  rd floor  my window looks out to the courtyard in the back of the building  i also work the front desk fire watch graveyard shift at this complex  there are business  in that courtyard too  so there s a business just below my window  and then there is the back of the complex i live in  the office of this complex is three stories down to the left of my back window  so you ve got two walls  one of which is the wall to the office of the complex  i would say a straight line to the office from my apartment would be about   ft  i had a very hard time connecting to wifi  router is in my apartment  but when i got the  netgear wifi range extender ex      configured  very simple to do  i ve got full bars  excellent connection  i would recommend this product  it was a night and day difference for me  well worth every penny i paid for it      
430,5.0 ,                       there was a learning curve involved but just refer to the online manual and it s pretty easy to troubleshoot and get it hooked up  even with the confusion with something i ve never done before  it was up and running in a half hour used to extend the signal from a comcast xfinity modem to the top floor of a large home      
431,1.0 ,                       i have a tech background  hooking it up was soooo easy  but then came the connection  i bought this to have my network extend into my garage  its funny because i have the netgear     r and this thing is awesome  it is really sad that i cant say the same thing for the range extenders  in fact it make me think why would you even sell a range extender that can not extend beyond my current network  do not biy this if you have a good router  end of discussion   just keeping it real      
432,5.0 ,                       because wi fi has to get through concrete walls and the internet gateway router is at one end of the space  coverage was unreliable at best  putting this in between eliminated all the issues  it took just a few minutes to set up the     ghz option  attempting to set up  ghz band was not feasible without going through a sign up on line process  so skipped it the size of the device is as described  but it seems smaller because it does so much note  haven t used tech support  but there s no way to not rate it  so   stars by default      
433,5.0 ,                       i have used this range extender now in a location where it had to penetrate an outside brick wall and a steel barrier in order to bring the signal into the covered sun porch  it worked perfectly there  i recently relocated and moved the router and was pleased at the concise and clear directions for re installation in the new location  thanks      
434,5.0 ,                       my router signal couldn t penetrate a large oak tree in my front yard to reach and led controller  too much trouble to move the router and several wired connections i have  i was able to install the range extender in another room with line of sight to the led controller now the signal reaches and it all works fine the led controller is connected to the extender  my alexa is connected to my router any request that i make of alexa to change color or brightness of the led s works as it should  because i read some reviews of alexa not working well with this extender i later connected one of my  nd generation dots to the extender and it works as expected also setup is a breeze  plug it in close to the router press the wps button on the extender then press the wps button on the router     ghz will connect  press the wps button on the extender then press the wps button on the router a second time   ghz will connect  if you have a dual band router and not using wep protocol  after connecting it to the router move it to a location of your choosing within range of the router      
435,3.0 ,                       followed instruction in the paper manual for browser setup  followed instruction on their web site still no luck neither with url or numerical ip address tried resetting to factory and multiple computers no success i started to research other name brands and was reading about tp link setup  their instructions allow ethernet cable from a pc to the extender for setup  netgear does not mention this    pc on existing wifi connection   connected pc to extender hard wired   entered               and setup page loadedupgraded from   star to   star       
436,5.0 ,                       i was having signal issues in the far side of the house  signal strength on  g and  g from the frontier router of between     and      the signal had to pass through   walls and the kitchen appliances  hooked this extender up and the signal strength went of     to       no more catching up on streaming  kind of important since we just replaced dtv with amazon fire tv in all rooms with big screens  next i am going to add one to my work shop on the back corner of the yard used review  it s good  but realize it s limitations   read on for the good stuff  bysergey evdokimov  to set up the extender via computer to set up via amazon fire tv as soon as the extender boots you connect to amazon fire tv   home screen   settings   network   see all networks   rescan   then select the netgear ext  expl  the set up screen will appear and you can follow the very simple instructions  don t forget to select your  g and  g network  enjoy https   smile amazon com dp b  r  cl e ref cm cr ryp prd ttl sol        
437,1.0 ,                       i thought that being netgear  it would be legit  first of all  you go through a lengthy setup process  ending with not being able to connect the device  when you call tech support  they take your information   have a tech call you back  this is where the red flags start  the tech asks permission to remotely access your computer  my husband told them he was unformfortable with that   would not grant them access  the tech then said he could walk us through the setup  which takes    minutes  but we would have to download a specific software   pay them      that s twice what we paid for the device  this promoted me to read the one star reviews   which all described identical experiences  this is a total scam to get you to spend more  grand access to your personal information to a complete random person  and possibly download a virus or trojan software  do not buy      
438,4.0 ,                       i bought this primarily to use with my amazon firestick  i have a       sq  foot home and the router is on the second floor  the   tv s with firesticks are downstairs  amazon prime works great on the firestick but i have additional streaming apps that i use and they sometimes buffer   especially live sportscasts   last night i watched a movie  not on amazon app  and no buffering  i also want to set up the firestick with an ethernet connection  i ordered the part from amazon for the firestick but it is on backorder so i haven t been able to test that function yet  so far very happy  i will try on live tv and ethernet and post a followup      
439,3.0 ,                       following all of the instructions  i plugged the unit into a wall out about    feet away form the wi fi router  the signal strength was weak and added nothing to the performance of my tablet  moved the unit to another outlet about    feet away and saw no change in performance  the led s indicated a weak signal  if i move it much closerit would be in the same room as the router      
440,4.0 ,                       this little extender has continued to work well  i have it set up in a window of the guest house so it can reach the wifi signal over in the main house  it does drop the signal every once in a while  but it s hard to tell if it is the extender or the wifi  we live in a rural area   however  i am very pleased with this product and am glad i bought it  we would not be able to receive any wifi signal in the guest cabin if we did not have this extender  so it works exactly as it should      
441,1.0 ,                       after reading the reviews i had high hopes for this  i received the item  brand new  opened it up and tried to set it up  but it was asking for a password already  so i hit the factory reset   nothing changed  did this about    more times before giving up and returning it  figuring it was a one off and requesting a replacement second item arrived  i open it and it s dusty  clearly used  and not only was it dusty but it also came with an unidentified cord which the original didn t include  so clearly nobody had even opened it when they received the return and then mailed it straight out  anyways  it requested a password which i expected  so i hit the factory reset  it was going smooth until after setting up my username  then the page crashed  tried again  same thing  tried again on a different browser  same thing  i gave up after that      
442,5.0 ,                       i put this in the hallway of my house in between the living room and my bedrooms so they all of my bedrooms could have full signal  it has done a good job so far  the setup was very easy it s all in the book  when you plug it in the power light will be orange  just leave it alone for a sec and it will turn green on its own  you press the wps button on your router and the device and it should connect  you have to plug it in near the router for the setup and then move it where you want it  great product so far  i will update if it starts sucking for any reason     
443,3.0 ,                       if you are extending a wps wi fi router you will experience a fantastically easy setup  my complaint is with the device s reliabilty  mine burnt out in less than a month  i had   laptops    desktop    tvs and   or   cellphones running on it  sometimes all concurrently  about three weeks after purchase  my devices could connect to it  it could connect to the main router but my devices could no longer get to the internet through it  and  the device itself was very warm to the touch  it may have been okay if stressed less  other users also taxing their home network may want to be cautious of this product  i continue to trust netgear however for low cost alternative network equipment  they are a good industry name for mass produced  low cost  mid security  network products  for the price  i may get two more so i can split the load  i had a couple of the next lower quality models laying around and fell back to them when this product failed     
444,4.0 ,                       i bought this to improve the speed for my peloton bike connection and it works awesome  every once and a while  and i m not sure why  i will lose speed and my screen will buffer and i look down at this device and the lights are no longer both green  happens maybe once a month   to fix  i just unplug and replug and let it run it s thing and it goes back online  i haven t needed to use it for my lap top  or any other devices  in the same area  i still go off the main router  but it has earned it s keep with my peloton bike      
445,4.0 ,                       when setting up the netgear ex     it took me more than one try to establish a link between the router and the extender   patience is needed to see the router link led turn green  sometimes more than one minute after wps handshaking   don t give up and think that there has been no connection   give the extender a chance to establish a solid link   product instructions are easy to follow   nice engineering at a low price making for good value      
446,1.0 ,                       so i set up the device right next to my router which pushes wifi between       mbs   as a test i ran a speed test with both signals   this projects that signal at  mbs   that s quite a reduction   rendering this useless   don t waste your money   just to make sure i was correct i ran a test at my office which has    mb  in this projected that speed at about         
447,4.0 ,                       worked fine after going through setup hiccups  i m one of those that struggled with setting this extender up  i tried it the wps way and the web browser way   neither worked  i left it alone and tried it again the next day  still nothing  so  i registered my  device online and called netgear support for help  after about       minutes on the phone with the representative  my extender was connected to my wifi and i moved it to my desired location  i will say a few things about this  some of the steps the representative took me through were not in the instructions  there was a lot of  resetting   waiting    seconds here and there  then hitting this that button and waiting     minutes  allowing for this that button to light up or stop blinking  etc  it would have been nice if the wps route had worked b c it appears to be the easier one but customer support just took me straight to the web browser steps  it was frustrating at first  but i m glad i got it connected      
448,2.0 ,                       they advertise this device will get up to    mbps   not even close   best i could achieve is         even strong signal close to the router which defeats the purpose of an access point   signal range is spotty   netgear support online did not help and i am not paying them to talk   very easy to install and setup but that s all   i am changing access points      
449,4.0 ,                       bought two of these to use in conjunction with netgear powerline      ethernet via house electric wiring modules  the powerlines distribute the ethernet throughout the house  garage and patio  and these extenders connect to them with a short cat   cord as access points to turn the ethernet into wifi that covers my driveway  dock and     acre yard  works like a charm and gets a better throughput  range and speed  than if i used the extenders alone to connect to my router via wifi  takes a couple minutes to configure      
450,5.0 ,                       i m using this as an access point not a range extender and it works well for that   we have multiple cameras connected to it and the signal seems to be strong across the coverage area   no problems streaming video from all of them installation was easy  it s all handled through a smartphone app   probably up and running in less than    minutes      
451,5.0 ,                       exactly what i was looking for  my daughter used to complain we had horrible wifi  we increased the speed and bandwidth  but it did not help  this extended the wifi from front bottom left to the complete top right back bedroom of our house  wish i had bought this years ago  and for the price    great deal  so happy      
452,2.0 ,                       pros    it is self contained and plugs directly into the wall    the lights make it fairly clear what is happening  does it have a solid signal to the router  green    setup was not too difficult  i ve set up a lot of network equipment so it wasn t any trouble to figure out how to use wps to connect with my router cons    the router light was almost always red  even though it was just down the stairs from my main router    the wifi connection would drop repeatedly during shows and sometimes we couldn t connect to it at all the bottom line  our wireless situation actually got worse after setting this up and all of us have switched back to using the main wireless router  i will be returning it but wanted to provide some information to you so you can make your own decision      
453,1.0 ,                       i am very disappointed in this product  it worked for a few months and now i cannot get it to connect to my internet at all  i ve tried every imaginable troubleshooting technique to no avail  and the warranty is next to nothing  so i m stuck with it  i ve read reviews by other people on the net and most are the same  piece of junk  wish i would have researched prior to purchasing      
454,1.0 ,                       my den with computers and big screen tv is at the opposite end of the house from the netgear router  therefore  reception when streaming on the tv was spotty and internet connections on the computer and smart phone were often difficult to achieve   i wasn t too hopeful that this range extender would solve the problem  i even doubted if i could install it properly     not being too tech savvy all began and ended well     i installed it in less than   minutes  placed it midway between the router and the den and all has been great ever  super fast connection to the internet  speedy browsing  perfect streaming of you tube and movies on the tv and no buffering issues to interrupt viewing  great product at a very reasonable price      
455,4.0 ,                       range extender works reasonable well   the initial setup failed as power went off in a recent severe storm   unfortunately my phone relies on the my high speed internet provider so resetting their equipment meant redials via cell when i could get a signal   contacting netgear was a challenge  tech staff super polite  but insisted on confirming all product serial and address information they needed from me in repeat fashion  a for alpha      z for zebra format   quite an ordeal   i suggest you set this up only when there is little likelihood of wi fi and internet service interruption   extender is just inside an upper story window and extends range about     feet to wi fi security cameras   it does the job      
456,1.0 ,                       so sad this did not work for us   tried connecting over a dozen times   all the lights would be green but would not let you sign in   instructions said to connect closer to modem  so plugged into the same plugin   couldn t get much closer than that   now sitting in box  not worth the postage to return         
457,1.0 ,                       after much research i bought this product august       it worked well but wasn t stable but it did okay  last night i noticed the device light blinking yellow so i turned it off and on  then the router light started blinking yellow  i did the same  upon turning it back on it shorted out  i realize there can be issues with any product regardless of manufacturer but i heard a  sizzle  or  crinkle  type of sound when i turned it back on and that s a big no for me      
458,1.0 ,                       i tried   and tried  and tried some more   and netgear technical support was along for much of the ride   i have such a basic setup with a netgear       g router   and yet it was so flaky  even after a firmware update   never got it to work   it seemed always like it was oh so close to working   but it kept dropping my device mere minutes after connecting it  never mind the underlying internet connection wasn t working     kept telling me the password was bad when it wasn t   or that i was setting up as access point  not range extender    i don t know    i like netgear but uy yuy yuy even if i ever got it to work  because i use access control list on my router that would have created a new headache because the range extender creates this stand in   pseudo   surrogate   replacement   proxy mac address when connecting through it   so any device that needed to use the extender  and we have a lot of devices    would need that alternative address entered in the router s access control list   big headache  that  so beware   this may be a problem common to all devices of its ilk  not just netgear s i m doing an rma to netgear under warranty  but i kind of think the replacement will behave no differently      
459,1.0 ,                       i have xfinity xfi  so i m pretty happy with my internet service  i can get upwards of    mbps download speeds  tested and verified   i purchased this extender to  extend  my already good service  this is rated to handle up to    mbps    the extension doesn t match or really come close to even     of the speed of a direct connection to my router  perhaps with an extension you lose some service with the relay  i can live with that  let s check the signal and see if it can reach some hard to find spots in the house  not even close  the extended signal is weaker than my original signal from my base router  i did a simple speed test at  speedcheck net  and there s a application for that   i m getting a better download speed off my base router than i am with the extender in the  dead  places in my house grrr    there is a firmware update  perhaps this has been addressed in the firmware update   buzzer sound   no  the firmware update actually killed the extender  it was a failed update where even the factory reset can t save the extender   the extender cannot power on properly to recognize a factory update  you can t log into the extender from the web to re do the firmware update  now i m required to do a manual push to the extender somehow using some macgyver method of patching to it directly i would recommend to stay away from this product  according to help forums this is a common problem and people who have this product can t seem to fix it  i hope to find a better product      
460,1.0 ,                       i wanted to use a signal booster  range extender  because of all the walls in my house interrupting the signal  and slowing it down  using this booster in my room  for example  has hindered my internet use considerably  and when i ran a speedtest this morning  i was amazed to see the numbers    i ran it while connected to this extender   and got the    mbps download speed      upload   which is my bigger concern  when connected to my household wifi  it was      download       upload speed  i was sorely disappointed in this product  it may have improved signal in some rooms of the house  but not in my room  again  the reason i made this purchase  to be fair  i re tested later  and it was      down and      upload speed frustrated with inconsistency  as i don t want to be hopping between servers  i probably won t really   but good luck at your house  with your purchase   the other reviews were good  at my house  it s not  doing a lot of good   sadly      
461,1.0 ,                       i bought this device to extend my wifi to reach bedroom and other upstairs areas better   first problem was when i tried to install  it wouldn t connect with wps button   so installed it manually   got it working   i have very fast internet speed over    mbs  dual band  g and  g   the extender worked for about   months  then mysteriously the  g band had no internet connection   the  g band worked fine  but bandwidth is too low on that to really do anything  too slow to stream or even download pictures    it would still connect to the actual  g extender network but it did not have an internet connection   of course this all started happening after   months and the tech support is only    days   i called amazon and they were very helpful and tried to help  they connected me to netgear and thats when they said i needed to spend     to extend the warranty and tech support to even continue talking to them over the phone   i told them to go fly a kite  i only paid     for the piece of junk   so now i m stuck with a useless piece of junk that stopped working after   months   now have to go buy a better model   do not waste your time on this piece of crap  spend the extra money and get something good      
462,5.0 ,                       there are cheaper wifi range extenders but i wasn t in the mood for a lot of problems and anything to do with home wifi settings can give you enormous headaches  really  really enormous headaches so i went with netgear because it s a popular brand which means if i ran into problems  i d be able to find other users online with the same problems and maybe solutions obscure chinese products are often very good  but you take your chances  and their manuals are almost always terrible the extender arrived today and i followed the set up instructions step by step and i had it up and running in       minutes without very much difficultly  the manual was good  but not great  there were some wrong turns i could have taken but i guess i was lucky   here s a tip  when you press the wps button  don t freak out if it doesn t turn green right away  it takes a little bit of time  if your router has a wps button  you re in luck  it makes the set up a lot easier i can t figure out if configuring it for  fastlane  would be smart or not so i just left it function as  basic   it works great  and i didn t want to foul things up  there are also unclear options on the website  but if you just let it be and keep it simple  everything will work i don t understand why i get a faster signal using this extender  but i do  and that s a very nice added benefit so  i played it safe and spent a little more money and bought the established brand because i didn t want any headaches  performance is great  the set up was snag free  that manual is fairly good  i wouldn t be surprised if this in the best in it s class in terms of performance and ease of set up could i have set up a cheaper unit just as fast with no aggravation  i ll never know  i just know that this is a good piece of equipment      
463,1.0 ,                       i had the device for   months and the it suddenly stopped connecting to the internet  i went through all the trouble shooting  i reset the device and even tried to connect directly to the device through the ip address to check firmware updates  nothing  it comes back and says the address is not responding i called netgear and there was a nice overseas tech support agent on the other line  all he asked me to do was plug it into a different outlet  what    the free tech support is just plug it into another outlet  since i was at   months of ownership  they wanted me to pay for their gearhead service for a level one tech to go into the device remotely and reset stuff  you know  all the things i tried to already do and it wasn t responding to my take on this is that if the device stops working  you get no help with the online troubleshooting  basically since none of the procedures they tell you about work or can be done   you start a case with them for the device  call a service tech who only tells you that he can only have you try plugging it into another outlet  then tells you that he cannot help you  you have to pay for there customer service help to fix something in a way that you already tried to do on your own but was not given access to by the faulty device the entire process only made me think they just wanted your contact info to sell to other vendors  the whole process is insulting to customers and in my view predatory on naive individuals who either just need the thing to work or don t know much about the tech side  you know the same way apple does with its genius bar help when it worked it was ok  nothing special  but i will never buy one there items again  when buy something and only have it for a short time  you shouldn t have to pay for tech support  especially for something as simple as a software reset on the device      
464,1.0 ,                       i bought this to increase the wifi signal  which is very weak  resulting in relatively slower dl s   for the second story of my home  because i read things like   faster wifi speeds   combined speeds up to     mbps   and   mobile up to      faster improve your mobile wifi speeds by up to      with ac    wifi range extender      both are direct copy pastes from the amazon sales page      unfortunately  on page   of the user manual  you find this gem   data traffic routed through the extender is inherently slower than traffic routed directly from the network  speed test results  with gigabit internet service  regular wifi     m down    m up  g extender     m down    m up  g extender     m down    m up the range extender has a much stronger signal  but is close to half the speed total waste of money      
465,5.0 ,                       ok  after reviewing the first few pages of raving reviews  out of thousands  on this netgear extender and the inexpensive cost  i figured what the heck   so i ordered one and accepted the risk of losing      easy set up  and within a few minutes  my modem got the relief it needed  and my netgear extender was accommodating the devices in my household with great  and consistent  signal strength for all to enjoy  hands down a bargain on a quality product      
466,1.0 ,                       horrible  this extender does not do the job in a two story home  it is approximately   ft away and one floor up from the router and it cannot maintain a stable signal  it goes out a few times a day and has done so in the middle of my podcast  military briefings  and my wife s virtual meetings with high up executives  i shouldn t have cheaped out  my mistake      
467,1.0 ,                       to begin with  i do not generally write reviews for products  i had to change my thinking on this since  so far  this product wowed me  i have had this wifi extender for less than   hours  i initially connected it using the wps settings  i didn t like the way it was working so i reset it to factory settings and reinstalled with the web browser option  wow  super easy   i moved the extender to my shop which is     feet  with lotsa big trees between   from my house  i put it in an upstairs window and turned it on  downstairs  i checked the signal with my android phone  it connected to the    ghz signal      mbps and the    ghz      mbps  incredible   i d bet that my laptop will also perform the same  the only thing that bothers me  w the android phone  is that when it connects it says that   internet may not be available   it always has internet available been so i ll have to look into that issue  i may come back sometime in the future  if i remember  and update this review  so far i am very happy   thanks netgear update a few days later well  it worked great for one day  the next day it wouldn t do anything so i power cycled it  it started working and did so for   more day  another power cycle and   more day of usage  today  it won t power cycle  the power light comes on   sometimes  but the unit won t do anything else  it s still within the amazon prime return window so back it goes  i can t decide whether to have it replaced with another  because when it worked it worked great   or try another brand   decisions  decisions      
468,1.0 ,                       i am truly disappointed on netgear wi fi extender in many ways  it supposed to be an easy install but it didn t work so i called the tech support  they wanted to access to my computer to do the set up  till this point everything was pleasant enough  once they checked my network they claimed that i have several hacks in my wi fi from china and i have to clean them up and they offered a security protection program for       to       up to   years  i told them i would like to talk to my wi fi provider and they should finish the installation of the wi fi extender and they claimed that it will not work  i contacted at t internet support they checked the system and they couldn t find any evidence of hacking  i have the latest fiber router recently installed  at t technician also mentioned there is no way such hack would be in my wi fi network  afterwards i installed the extender myself and found out the extender is actually working worse than my at t router  where i get over     mbps directly from the router the extender barely made    mbps  so it is on its way back to netgear  i am very disappointed on netgear they used to be success story  now they look like they are trying to take advantage of people  on another note if your wi fi hacked it would only be serving others to get online and it has nothing to do with your wi fi extender  shame on you netgear       
469,4.0 ,                       easy to set up and have had no problems with it except one  when i installed it the wifi signal was strong through out my home  but i did notice last night the wifi signal was  fluctuating  where normally it was steady  but i had no problem with the internet as far as speed  also i didn t realize until i bought and installed it that you have to create  another wifi  for each original wifi you have installed  we have a regular wifi and a  g  so we had to double the wifi sources in the house  so now we have wifi  extended  and  g  extended  along with our original wifi  not a big deal  but you do have to swap to different wifi sources on your device depending on your signal and where you are located  still  i would recommend this netgear extender for the price and performance       
470,4.0 ,                       we have a cable modem with a         ghz netgear router downstairs   over the years as we ve seen more and more networks show up on  available networks  as our neighbors have got on line  we ve seen a definite decrease in our ability to connect upstairs  coincidence i don t know    regardless we decided to try this extender before looking for other solutions such as a new router   the first extender we received was dead on arrival   plugged it in no power in a chat session with amazon and after describing the problem  amazon immediately sent us a new one plus a no cost return label for the bad one   no requirement that i send the bad one back first   great service and i m glad i had the chat session because it probably saved some time the new unit works just fine so far   i did the setup as listed in the quick start brochure that came with it using my browser instead of wps   the default names  ssid  for the extender on each band was slightly different so i used them   it offered a choice of security options and i chose wpa  which is what i use on my primary router   one confusion i had was that while the initial extender setup page asked for a unique password  later  when i had to positively  select if i wanted it for just one or both bands  that required using the password for my primary router   that part of the setup instructions wasn t completely clear   i suggest reviewing other reviews that discuss setup before setting this up   based on initial performance i d give it   stars  but the less than completely clear instructions dropped it to   so far after placing the extender upstairs  our connection there has gone from either zero to one bar to three bars   if this continues  it s worth every penny      
471,4.0 ,                       works as intended   wireless router in the front office of the house  put this unit in the kitchen halfway in the middle of the house  and now we can stream netflix or hulu in the back bedroom  complete opposite end of the house from the router   took me all of   minutes to get this set up   start in the same room as the router  plug it in  once power light goes green push wps  then wps on the router   once they link up and the signal light goes green  connect a device to the wireless signal   then you can unplug and put it in the final location halfway to the area you are trying to boost      
472,1.0 ,                       this product is terrible   don t waste your money  i spent an hour on the phone with customer service to set it up for my mom at her house because they website they gave wasn t coming up on her computer which was a red flag to me right off the bat   teh customer service rep finally helps me get it all set up   it worked when i left    months later i visit and notice it s not working   when we put in the password to connect and it says unable to join network  i ve done everything it says to do in the instructions  it stays it s connected  and it still doesn t work   i ve confirmed the password via the account we set up and still nothing   i tried to contact customer service and they said you can t speak to someone in customer service because it s been    since the purchase  so there s basically nothing that we can do   and now i can t return it  we even still have the box because i didn t trust it  how convenient for them to put such a strict timeline on a terrible product  terrible product and terrible customer service  i m an honest person   don t buy it  thanks amazon as well for condoning a terrible that i can t return      
473,5.0 ,                       i have frontier fios wifi          well  sort of  in my area  there was a tremendous response to a promotional offer  and as more and more piled on  the speed has suffered and is way  way below that  but my older verizon wifi extender that supported fios         wasn t compatible with this  so the hunt was on for a wifi extender i began with the frontier extender and discovered that it ran hot enough to cause a fire potentially  so off it went i trust the netgear name  and this one can support higher than         and is so well priced  and it arrived nicely packed  instructions that are clear but kind of not that clear for me  totally a non techie it works  and once you discover how to make it work  it s so easy and yay  success    press the wps button on the side of the extender which you must plug into an outlet really close to your router  it will blink  cute    within   minutes  press the wps button on your router  so far  the instructions are really clear  the ones in the booklet that accompanies this    i didn t need to repeat step   in the booklet  it is smart enough to handle this all on its own  the  ghz  why is the little z always little  strange  right     in a minute or maybe even instantly  the extender names will show up on your wifi network  like netgear ext  and some other netgear names that you can ignore as i did  for a bit  no idea why a few showed up  oh well    type in mywifiext net next  and it s a popup box thing  complete the questions  which will ask after your name and password and secret questions are created for next  then you ll see maybe   sources  the usual and the  g  each  well  mine does  has different user names and passwords  toss those in  click away and it takes maybe   minutes to process  and it may even say you re transmitting on an insecure  poor thing  network  and voila  then you will have done it you can then unplug the extender  and don t drop it as you proudly cart it off to the area you want it  me  in the living room  close to my outdoor courtyard where i hadn t had any wifi   plug it in  resist your moments of disappointment as it will likely show up with an amber light  not the green yet  it took mine almost two minutes to go green i did it  you can do it so much more easily and with confidence  yay      
474,3.0 ,                       this is a great range extender hardware wise  it has   modes  lets you extend your wifi to wifi  wifi to ethernet port  or as an access point ethernet port to wifi   the range is good and i like the simple wall plug format  the biggest drawback is you can t use this without registering your email address and registering   extreme sensitive personal questions such as my mother s maiden name  what city my mother father was born  best friend s name  etc    why do i need to give such sensitive information just to use a wifi range extender        
475,4.0 ,                       i do not use a lot of extreme data apps  so i can generally use my smartphone data without going over  but i also have a wifi   only tablet  and needed a better signal in the back yard about    feet from the  house  i have a cheapo western digital dual band router  which is on the  nd floor at the farthest point  about     feet  from my shady lawn spot  the signal is fine inside  but the outside signal strength from the router was fair to poor  with frequent youtube freeze ups i installed this extender in the walkout basement  about    feet from my outside spot  signal strength is now good to strong  i just watched a    minute video with no freeze ups at all i flirted with the idea of buying a better router         instead  but decided to try this extender first  for someone in my shoes  i d recommend this extender  i m sure this extender is not screaming fast  and i do not know how well it would handle multiple devices  i also was not able to get the   ghz band set up on it  but that might be a router issue      band works well enough for my needs on the tablet      
476,5.0 ,                       this is a life saver for me  i needed a solid connection for work  and im only allowed to use wired  problem was  i live out in the country  i used this to repeat my hotspot signal  because the only option is satellite  and it is horrible  the upload and download speeds are great  and the ping is much better than the satellite  and all of this is just off of a hotspot  there is no delay  i forget it is coming from a hotspot sometimes  i recommend this repeater for anyone who needs a wired connection from a wifi signal or you need to extend the range  it is a huge help      
477,3.0 ,                       pros   the price  not too ugly  it works  kinda cons   quirky setup   seems like most folks can t get internet to work on both    ghz and  ghz and i had  and have  the same problem    ghz kept self selecting the dreaded     ip address   finally in my umpteenth setup  i chose to not select a    ghz frequency   in fact  mine that it had already found  one minus umpteenth  time was not even listed   finally   ghz worked   and so did    ghz   back to  ghz and it worked   back to    ghz   and the dreaded     ip had relocated to the lower frequency   okay   i can deal with it   back to  ghz and working   whew   let s try    ghz again   and the dang thing worked again   quirky     i guess it may have something to do with a      firmware update and maybe there s a new one   but  it you can mess with it and reboot your router occasionally  installing a smart surge protect required it   weeks ago and installing ooma last week did  too   you ll probably be happy enough with this   if not  call your electricity and internet providers and cancel your service   this is the new world   live with it     stars for now   higher later if it doesn t crap out and lower later if it does and i return it      
478,5.0 ,                       this worked great for my family   with remote learning two teens and both parents working from home i bought two of these to give everyone a good signal were we all work the most   good instructions   i didn t get it to work first time but  nd worked like a charm   probably something i did wrong   had it for    days and still working well      
479,5.0 ,                       so i spent about  hour getting a cisco re     setup to my apple airport express and i just could not get them connected  and it took about   minutes on each try and then i would have to reset and wait for it to come back up etc      i got so frustrated that i bought this ac    which luckily was prime  day  nice  and with some reservations on how long it would take to setup i began   i simply plugged the ac    into an outlet  connected to the ssid and then i was in   then from the easy to use user friendly utility that launched  i simply logged into my existing router and i was up and running     it could not have been any easier   my nest cam has been connected for about    hours without dropping so i am pleased   great price and easy setup      
480,5.0 ,                       easy installation and placement near my tv has increased my wifi strength from   or   bars to    i grew impatient with netflix and other web based channels crapping out in the middle of a show  a plus is the ethernet connection which i use to bring a denon bluray player online  another will go in the basement and upstairs  an inexpensive way to bring wifi throughout an old stone walled house  hint   it s especially good paired with a netgear router      
481,2.0 ,                       i ve tried a couple extenders and this one fails to perform  its signal is too weak to be of value streaming from the opposite side of the house regardless of which band  i bought a different unit and had much better results  where this one lead to buffering   stuttering   and pixelation   others will provide much better experiences  that said  installation is super easy and setup takes only a couple minutes      
482,1.0 ,                       ordered this along with a new netgear nighthawk router modem combo hoping to get a little better signal near our garage   got it set up but it kept going off   tried their tech support and literally got phished   the online virtual tech asked for my phone number and would have someone call me right away   dumb me did and yes someone from a foreign country called me and tried to hack my computer   kept trying to tell me that my computer was out of date and then tried selling me some bull crap to help clean it up   i immediately shut down my laptop and hung up the phone   i sent it back and got a full refund      
483,2.0 ,                       i got this to extend our wifi out to the driveway where our camper is parked  between the main wifi router and the camper is only   ft or so  but we have a brick house and part of the concrete structure garage in the way  so signal out there is weak if we get one at all  i tried this thing everywhere in between  even outside in an outdoor outlet  and every location i either got an amber device light saying the device was too far away  or the amber router light saying the router was too far away  the     had less trouble as it s the further reaching band but i was still only getting     bars out in the camper on my phone and     bar on the xbox  not enough to watch netflix  barely enough to watch youtube   ghz band never connected with either device  wouldn t even show up on the xbox  all this to say that with my main wifi router  the xbox reads   bars at     and   bar at    with interference dropouts being the main issue  so this extender is effectively worse than my main router even at half the distance  netgear is usually a good brand  we ve only ever had netgear routers with great results  but this definitely falls short  will be returning for a broader range extender      
484,2.0 ,                       i bought this to extend wifi reception to the other end of the house    feet from our router  i first tried placing the extender in the next room    feet from the router  but i could not get a signal  we had been getting some signal to our ipads in that room but this extender could not connect  so i placed the extender in a direct line of sight    feet from the router  then i was able to get a connection  it seemed to work for a few weeks  but now it is getting poor to none connection to the router  i get a better signal at the other end of the house without the extender  conclusion  this is a needless piece of garbage  don t waste your money on it i also tried to update the firmware and the netgear website doesn t have a way to access the update unless you have registered your email and password  and there is no way to correct password verification problems  so if there is a typo in your name or password you are basically locked out of any tech support      
485,3.0 ,                       getting it set up and connected wasn t too difficult   i m just disappointed that it didn t improve the wifi signal   didn t hurt it either   according to my internet speed test app  my connection pc lite  nothing changed  still getting     mbps  same as before   i guess that s not bad  considering     mbps is the fastest centurylink has available in my area  i was getting about     mbps before i moved the pc to another room  a bit farther from the modem router   i thought this range extender would bump it back up to close to     mbps  but it didn t      
486,4.0 ,                       definitely not plug and play if you do not have a wps button on the router  installing was quite a challenge to say the least so i took a    hour break from attempting the installation and when i tries again it took    minutes and voila great signal now  i did not use tech support maybe because im stubborn but i didnt want to be on the phone while hooking the extender up      
487,1.0 ,                       this wifi extender spends more time not working than it does working attempting to extend bot     and     ghz signals  it works about     of the time   it often clocked     mbps according to ookla speed test running only     ghz  it gets up to    mbps but it is very intermittent   yes i have troubleshooted the hell out if it   i am very familiar with bandwidth traffic and signal strength also technical support is difficult to find   if you google search for you  you can easily find a scam website fully prepared to set you up to let them inpast your firewall and do lord knows what to your system and personal info on the bright side  my brother had a way better experience with the netgear nighthawk x  ac     but that s          
488,5.0 ,                       i ve been using this product for about a month now and it has worked flawlessly every single day  my router is located downstairs  on the other end of my house  my wifi used to barely reach my room  after   minutes of setup  i have great internet  did a speed test to compare speeds  the first test       mbps download speed  was without the extender  the second test        mbps  was with the extender  it nearly tripled my speed  very happy with the product  well worth the cost  only wish i would ve purchased it sooner      
489,3.0 ,                       follow the instructions and this isn t difficult to set up  downside is that it creates   new networks      and   ghz  that you need to have your devices memorize  i ve had extenders  including netgears  that didn t do that  a nice point is that  if you want to run a physical ethernet cable  this can be an access point rather than an extender  i ll probably do that soon it s inexpensive enough that i m comfortable using it outside  well under cover  to provide coverage for my yard  so far  so good      
490,4.0 ,                       i live in an old house with a lot of brick and plaster   as you know  these things are kryptonite for wifi signals   we have one absolute deadspot in the front of the house that s the furthest away from our router s signal   this extender works perfectly to provide coverage in that area   keep in mind that your internet speeds won t be as fast when connected to the extender as they would be directly connecting to the router   however  i can still get internet speeds of    mbps download and    mbps upload when using it   so it s not a problem at all   these are definitely fast enough   no complaints there   just something to keep in mind if you ve got a super slow and archaic rural internet connection i d love for the antennaes to be a little bit longer  but it s fine   our home s only deadspot is completely covered in signal now   if i really absolutely needed longer antennaes i would have bought the more expensive netgear extenders      
491,5.0 ,                       i saw a review that said this unit was hard to set up  and there were a lot of comments attached to that review     after setting mine up i don t understand why that person was having so much trouble  the quick start guide that came in the box was all i needed  i did use my ipad to find it and set it up  which is what the quick start guide suggested anyhow   use a wifi network manager on a computer or wifi device to find and connect to the netgear ext  ssid  wifi network    worked   i did  out of curiosity  take a look at the wifi network on my desktop system and it sees the device too  i could have gone either way   after setting it up in my lower level family room i took it upstairs and plugged it in near the living room entertainment system  after a minute or so i started up my new dvd player and set up the connection  i tested netflix and i m streaming video    something i couldn t do before  i m completely satisfied      
492,5.0 ,                       installed in no time  using wps method  as i hoped  i can now access the camera on my ring doorbell thru my phone much more quickly  it also seems to enable my phone to connect with a wemo smart plug from places in the house that it couldn t before  my only issue is that my wall outlets are installed with the slots stacked horizontally  so now i need to order a rotating outlet adapter so the extender can be installed with its antennae pointing up  not sideways  lol      
493,1.0 ,                       this doesn t work for me at all  i live in an rv park and i thought that this would boost my signal  the thing is you have to press the router and this at the same time which i can t do because i don t have a router  so it s honestly absolutely completely useless to me  the only reason i m not returning it is i got a damaged box special and i got a really really good price and i know i will eventually use it  but as of right now it s pointless  i ll update whenever i do have somewhere where i can use it     
494,5.0 ,                       i purchased a cheaper version of this and was very disappointed   unfortunately  i kept it and lived with the slow wi fi or no wi fi connection in parts of my house   i stumbled across this one and thought it couldn t hurt   mixed reviews  but most were good   i am so happy that i purchased this   i don t have to remember a weird password  it s the same password as your original router and it takes minutes to synch     i am very happy with my purchase   i couldn t wait to write a review endorsing this product      
495,4.0 ,                       installed this to extend wifi coverage on the second floor of my home  i am not very knowledgeable of home networking  but i was able to set this up quite easily which is a huge plus for me placement is very important  you need to ensure that this extender is still within range and receiving a strong signal from your existing wifi network router   it will not boost or increase the speed  it will only pass through what it is able to receive  if you place this in an area where it receives a weak signal  it will simply extend or repeat the weak signal  i used a wifi speed app on my phone to identify the dead zones in the house as well as places where the signal was still strong enough to connect the extender you need to connect your devices to either the range extender or your wifi router  if you move from one area of the house to another  you will have to change the network on your device to connect to the strongest signal while this worked to extend coverage effectively  i ultimately purchased a whole house wifi system with mesh technology  it s much more robust than the extender  this ensures full wifi coverage throughout the home and devices automatically switch between the access points to ensure the best speed while you move about the house      
496,1.0 ,                       i have a background in it networking and haven t used a wifi extender in years so i figured i d give this a shot  bad decision     this is not so much as a wifi extender  but a repeater  it uses the exact same channel as the main wifi router  this means it interferes with your original signal  for any access point  you should always use a different channel so you don t get interference  not possible     in an area with poor signal from my standard issue fios router  about   mbps on a    mbps connection   i thought this would really help out  i plugged the device in half way between the two areas  keep in mind  half way is literally    feet away with no walls  i connect to this device  and the speed is   mpbs  that s right  it s slower than not using it at all     i figured i would put this in access point mode as a last ditch effort  plugged into the router and broadcasting it s own wifi signal  standing next to the router and the device  main wifi signal from router     mbps  speed from this device  which is hardwired to the router     mbps     this device literally does not work  don t waste your money or be enticed by a    off for prime members coupon      
497,2.0 ,                       bought this extender on a whim based on a spotty wi fi strength in my house   the house is concrete block with a metal roof and a lot of rebar which seems to attenuate the signal strength   i was having difficulty getting adequate signal to a remote video camera which was only about    feet from the wi fi hub   signal strengh at the device was    db where     is considered an adequate signal installation and set up was quite easy for both     and   gig  and the unit was set up about    feet from the security camera   all signal lights on the unit are in the green   the signal health on the camera improved to    db which makes it usable  but not optimal   the camera is the only device on this sub network   saw some improvement but was hoping for a lot more realizing that this is low priced model   conversely  it is also not a complete failure  either      
498,2.0 ,                       does what it s supposed to do  it took a bit of fiddling around as the instructions didn t work as stated  once you type in the address it was supposed to walk you through a wizard but it never popped up  i went to my wifi connections and clicked on it there  ran through the steps and nothing happened  it took about     minutes to finally kick in after that for the light to turn green  since then it works great update   this thing looses connection about once a day and sometimes has to be unplugged and restarted  i ve only had it for a few weeks      
499,4.0 ,                       i ve switched to streaming tv service and was looking to extend my wife service to my lanai and br on far side of the house from where my modem router is located  set up was very simple using the wps in the same room then located the repeater to the middle of the house   now my lanai and master br get   bars of signal instead of     portable devices that move from room to room don t automatically switch like a mesh system does but that doesn t seem to be a problem for my      square foot home  this was a very cost effective way for me to get better signal to my roku devices around the house so i am quite happy   can t quite give   stars but would do     if the option was there   may be moving to a larger home in another state where i would consider a mesh system but for my current need this simple device does what i need   only been using for several months so will see if it holds up over time but so far so good      
500,4.0 ,                       i have purchased   of these over the last year to enhance wifi coverage   the product seems to function well although i have noticed the signal is not as strong when there are a few walls between this device and the router   suspect the advertised range assumes absolutely nothing is hindering the signal which is probably not a very common installation      
501,3.0 ,                       for the most part this gets the job done for my needs  i have a shop out back at my house and its controlled by a echo flex  the flex doesn t seem to have the best wifi range  so i bought this  it works great to get better signal out there  but i m a big gamer also  and i set my pc to the repeaters separate wifi signal  and it lagged every time i tried to play a game  so i switched back to my nighthawk xr    s wifi and my games ran perfect again even though it has less signal directly to the router  but that s not what i got it for      
502,1.0 ,                       not much to like  after getting it installed  the smart phones connected to it  but even though the   apple laptops in the family connected to it  a message popped up saying  two devices are trying to use the same ip address  and neither would work  i am fairly computer literate  but i couldn t  fix  the issue and after much fiddling i gave up  the fact that two devices were attempting to use the same ip address rendered the extender useless on the two laptops  there was noyhing in the instructions on how to fix the issue  i did notice that in the settings it said configure the ip address automatically  so i am assuming there is a major issue in the extender s sofware      
503,1.0 ,                       no stars   returned it   massive pia to try to decipher the tech argot of the directions and it didn t work anyway   i bought it to extend the range of my router s wifi signal for an outdoor camera   even after all the irritation involved with getting it paired to the house wifi and then plugging the extender into an outlet closer to the camera  it had zero impact on the camera s signal   the location receives a strong   bar signal from the router  too   there s no phone number to call for help with the setup unless you register the product first   the website you have to go to for the setup process doesn t even bother to tell you up front  where it might be helpful  that you won t ever see the setup assistant until you access netgear s web pages through the extender s wifi  not your home router s wifi   the website has links for setting up with a pc or mac  but the one for macs doesn t work  the page never loads   well  not until you ve accidentally come across that information  on a completely different page that you found while looking for set up help  that you have to access netgear s pages through the extender s wifi signal  not the wifi from your own router if you finally get to the setup assistant you will be asked questions you have no clue how to answer because they re all in tech speak   why is it necessary to call a password a  network key    why don t you just say  password     make sure your computer is set up to use dhcp    really   i ll get right on that   i ve been using personal computers for    years and have never seen the term  dhcp  and have no idea how to check that my computer is set up to use it  but since you bring it up  why don t you tell me how to  make sure  of that   worthless   the whole instruction guide is like that and the setup assistant is worse by far   and hey  did you know that  wps does not support wep network security    who cares  if you don t know what either of those things are and if they don t tell you how to determine which your wifi has   the manual will tell you things like   click the next button and the status screen displays    wrong   like a lot of the other steps   you know what happens when you click next   the setup assistant completely vanishes and you end up back on netgear s main web page   you are not offered something logical for the next step in the process  like a log in setup option  or a flashing neon sign that says  setup complete  or any information on the status of the device you think you maybe might have possibly just set up   nothing   here s our web page   enjoy this total lack of feedback about what you were just trying to accomplish and whether it worked or not no idea whether their phone tech support is any good or not because i put the device back in the box and printed a return label  but phone support is good for only    days anyway   besides  you have to register the product first  so they can have your personal information and probably put you on        mailing lists for spam  before they ll give you access to the super duper secret classified help line number   never trust a company that won t give you free phone setup help in its instruction manual      
504,3.0 ,                       so initially i set this up using the same ssid  imagining my device to seamlessly connect to the one with the stronger signal  i had imagined wrong  as it s not a mesh network  and i really shouldn t have  honestly learned my lesson that way  but only really wanted to extend my network range around a fridge blocking signals at the dining table  speed testing has a steady good speed  but occasionally there d be some random drops  again not an issue  as i m not really gaming  just circumventing a blind spot  for that  this was enoughand yet the main reason for my   stars was that even with a different ssid  connecting to it was a pain  and i don t mean switching networks  i mean every time i try  it takes its d mn time to connect to it        seconds  always stuck at the  acquiring ip  step  like there s not a network it s attached to  and before i m opening up a webpage  or an app page      minutes have passed  tried putting it in a different outlet  an empty one at that  hoping to circumvent any power cables that might be interfering  but nothing  same issue applies throughout      
505,4.0 ,                       basically wifi was fine at my house until i put a smart bulb in an outside light  wifi was spotty in that part of the house but the bulb kind of worked then i got a ring doorbell in the same part of the house and video was choppy and the doorbell was sometimes unresponsive i moved the router as close as i could but didn t want to lose connection in the other parts of the house so i opted for a range extender and doing some research i decided on this one so i ve had it more than a week now and my ring doorbell works better as do a couple smart bulbs  so basically i m happy so far only downside as noted by others is that it creates new ssid s so if you re using it for mobile devices that move around the house a lot it might not be what you want but if its for things where you connect to a specific wifi network and then just forget about them  like ring products  smart bulbs  roku  etc   it seems to work ok      
506,4.0 ,                       it might have just been my modem settings but i was unable to activate it easily by using the wps button  it would say my password was incorrect even when i know it wasn t  i was able to set it up by connecting my phone to it   plan b on the instructions  and typing in the  website  into my browser  this worked before i updated the firmware and then i reset the extender and when i tried to set it up again  typing in the website wouldn t work  it just wouldn t do anything  so i had to edit the settings from my wifi network list on my phone and click manage router after i was connected  also i will point this out in case anybody got this for the same purpose as me    my work given computer only works with an ethernet cable but i didn t want to be stuck sitting at my kitchen counter forever and i definitely didn t want to buy a    ft ethernet cable and run it across my house just to move my computer to a different room  i bought this so i can plug it in anywhere and use it s ethernet port to connect to my work computer  well because of certain settings on my work computer  it will not connect to this extender  the message i get is something about the dhcp  this problem i only had on my work computer i know it has to do with the computers settings that i can t change  ethernet port works just fine on my person computer      
507,3.0 ,                       this product doesn t work as it advertises   you can not move it once you set it up that s it   move it and it loses it mind and you have do it all over so it no better than the last one i bought and returned   in fact the cheaper one did better at this   so you don t get the reach because you never get to move it to the edge of the wifi bubble  it also doesn t rech like it says   i thought that the move expensive the futher the reach   well this us absolutely not true   brick walls and bathrooms seem to stop it just like the cheap one      
508,5.0 ,                       great product  initially while purchasing had a doubt whether it will work or not because my modem is installed on a corner edge on the top floor and my wifi garage door opener cant even find the wifi network but soon after installing it on the first floor  was able to get wifi signal in place that doesn t even show wifi range  so happy with that and highly recommend this product        
509,3.0 ,                       most recent update  while searching to find a better wifi extender i discovered the reviews and documentation on many other moderately priced extenders either didn t mention mac address filtering  had many user complaints that this feature didn t work  or alluded to similar  virtual mac addresses    i experimented a little more with this repeater and discovered their new  virtual addresses  were really the actual hardware addresses of the connected device  an address which i had already entered into the router table  but with the first three hexidecimal pairs replaced with  o   f b     thus  a device with a real mac address of   a  b  c  d  e  f  would be forwarded to the router as  o  of b   d  e  f    why do they do this   the real address is already in the router table   they re forcing me to add a second address for every device that might connect to the repeater with this  pig latin  version of a mac address   but  at least i now know how to configure the table  and making altered duplicates of the existing entries was easier than their suggested method of turning off mac filtering  running around the house to every device which might work better using the repeater and connecting it to the repeater  trying to discover new mac addresses on a dynamically updating  connected device  list  writing down these new mac addresses  turning mac filtering back on to expose the mac address tables  and typing the newly discovered virtual addresses into the table   i still don t understand why they screw around with the mac addresses instead of just using the real address  or why they don t document how their  virtual mac addresses  are formed  but now that i know their secret i got it to work so i m keeping the repeater                                                   new problems   turns out the mysterious  android  address i had to add to get the extender to work only fixed the problem for my phone   in addition to the five mac addresses for the extender  every device that connects to the extender generates a new  virtual mac address  that has to be added to the router table   for mobile devices  which might sometimes connect to the main router and sometimes connect to the extender  this means entering two mac addresses in the router table   the actual hardware address which i already have and a new  virtual  address which i can only discover by turning off mac filtering and looking for a new  undocumented device   i m sending this repeater back and getting one from a competitor                                                                                          i rated this a     overall because once i finally got it configured it seems to work pretty well  and if you don t want to limit access based upon mac addresses it s pretty easy to set up   configuring it for mac filtering  however  was a nightmare   that feature is mostly undocumented  what documentation does exist is misleading  and although their tech support was friendly and tried to be helpful  they didn t know much about mac filtering   i m not an it expert  but i ve configured several home wifi routers and repeaters in the past with no problem   mac filtering was a pain because i had to find the mac address of every device i wanted to connect and type that address into a table in the router and also type these addresses into a table in the repeater  but it worked   it took me maybe    minutes to get this range extender working without mac filtering   i spent probably   or   hours getting it to work with mac filtering  including probably   hours working with netgear s tech support staff my first challenge was finding the mac address of the extender   there was no documentation on how to find this address   the documentation simply said  connect everything you have to the extender and then copy all the mac address that show up on your router into the mac table   no can do   not all the devices i have are within range of the extender   most connect directly to the router   and several devices that i need to connect to the extender belong to children who weren t home at the moment   also  some weird devices  neighbors   show up in the connection table whenever i turn off mac filtering  so i don t want to add any  unknown  devices to the mac authorization and give them unlimited access to my network   so  i connected some devices and looked at the list of connected devices  which changed dynamically as lightly tasked devices periodically touched base   nothing that looked remotely like a netgear repeater showed up on most devices you need to dig down into a  settings  menu to find the mac address   no such luck with this extender   i also couldn t find any reference to it in the documentation or in the installation wizard  so i contacted tech support   they said it was printed on the label on the back of the device   i had looked at the label and successfully found a number which i correctly guessed to be the serial number  needed to contact tech support  by using a bright light and reading glasses   there were other numbers  unlabeled  which i assumed were specific model numbers  lot numbers  etc   by using a bright light  reading glasses  and a powerful magnifying glass i now saw that one had the word  mac  written in even tinier letters  placed vertically  beside it   configuring this device is not for the visually challenged  or for anyone with less than perfect eyesight   i hadn t recognized this as the mac address because  contrary to common practice and to what the netgear start up guide said  it wasn t configured like a mac address   i would have instantly recognized  f      b         as a hexidecimal mac address   the label presented it as  f    b       which looks remarkably like a serial number or lot number   the tech support person also said i d have to reset to factory defaults after i entered the mac address into my router i entered the hardware mac address  reset to factory defaults  and reconfigured the repeater from scratch   several times   still no luck   then  in what looked like a footnote to one of the error messages i received  i noticed wording that said  make certain you enter these mac addresses in your router    they provided four mac addresses which were formatted as mac addresses  but strung together so it was tough to see where one ended and the other began   during one of the many periods i spent searching online for tips on configuring this extender i had read that netgear used something called  virtual mac addresses  instead of a hardware address  so i replaced the hardware address with these four   still no luck the next call to tech support took several hours   she had me reset to factory default several times  enter the hardware mac address in addition to the four virtual mac addresses  and change several settings on my router   still no luck   the extender would connect to the router and devices would connect to the extender  but the extender refused to provide them with ip addresses   the tech support person finally declared that it must be a router problem and said i needed to call the router manufacturer s tech support more searching on the internet   now that i had the problem narrowed down to  netgear extender connects to devices but won t provide ip addresses  i found an entry in the netgear knowledge base  why couldn t tech support find that   which said  turn off mac filtering and look at the connect table for any devices with mac addresses that begin with these three character pairs    i did that  and after watching the table go through a few refresh cycles i spotted something labeled  android  with the correct mac prefix   i added that to my mac table  the   th mac address for a single repeater  and everything started working   so in the end  my repeater works  but i feel i m being generous in giving a     rating to a product that does not provide you with the required mac addresses in its documentation  its installation software  or through its tech support representatives      
510,5.0 ,                       we live in the boonies   no cable  no dsl  and satellite internet is improving but still pricey for unlimited  but we already have unlimited data on our cellular plan   added a hotspot to the unlimited cellular plan   used this to  extend  the hotspot s signal then plugged the ethernet cable on this extender to the broadband port on our home route and viola   no longer limited to   or    connections and now full range across our home network   in my experience this works more reliably    is much more cost effective than the expensive specialty routers we used previously to do basically the same thing  cradlep    and mof        
511,1.0 ,                       zero doesn t exist so i gave a one star  i contacted technical support to get assistance with setting up the extender and the guy was very rude  he asked me for the serial number on the back of the extender and when i said the information was too small to read  he said that was not his problem  throughout the entire conversation  he was condescending and rude  i asked for his name and the name of his supervisor and he asked me why i wanted the information  i told him because he had poor customer service skills  when he refused to give me his name and supervisor s name  he then asked me if i would be willing to pay for assistance to set up the extender  i will never buy anything from netgear again based on that experience  i am also returning the extender i purchased because it doesn t work  junk  junk  junk      
512,1.0 ,                       this product is absolutely garbage  i tried every single setting possible  first of all  i don t think i got a dud device  i just think this device is awful  one main reason is its fast lane technology for some reason fast lane technology only works as follows  the extender has to connect to the router via a    ghz connection and broadcast the connection as  ghz  or the extender receives the connection as a  ghz connection and extends the connection as a    ghz connection  why can t  ghz extend  ghz and    ghz extend    ghz   the connections  both    ghz and  ghz are very unstable  i don t know what s going on  please do not buy this device         
513,3.0 ,                       bought this because i thought there was a problem with my original one  exact same model  from       but turned out to be a different problem not the extender   however  comparing the two units  this new one provides only about     of the signal strength of the old one  very disappointing   but  decided to keep this new one as a backup for when the old does eventually die  too much of a hassle to return it for the          
514,5.0 ,                       i purchased this device to help increase   keep a constant wifi signal between   houses on the same property  in a very wooded area    the main internet   wifi router is stationed in the main house and this extender was plugged in the  nd house roughly     feet away   the wifi signal boosted      immediately   no problems staying connected   wifi works great on the tv  laptop and smartphones  before installing this extender the wifi signal in the  nd house registered no bars to one small bar on my smartphone and nothing on laptop   tv   now all devices have   or more bars all the time    i followed all the setup connection instructions and allowed the extender to remain plugged in in the same room as the main wifi router for at least   hrs before i moved it   plugged it in next door at the  nd house        
515,1.0 ,                       one day i realized the password to one of the sign on was changed   it was hacked   the company sent update to prevent it was little too late   i have no idea if the hacker was able to penetrate my main sign on or not but hope that did not happen i no longer use this extender afraid that will invite the hacker try to access my wifi      
516,5.0 ,                       the wifi signal from our router modem is plenty strong enough for our daily needs  however  i bought this to extend the signal into our backyard  as we had a christmas morning video chat with out of state family  this worked perfectly  we were able to chat for over an hour without an lag or issues  it was fairly simple to set up  just followed the directions and once set up  i plugged into the outlet on our back porch  fyi when you plug it in where you intend to use it  it does take a few minutes for it to be ready so don t panic if it doesn t show up in the list of ssid options on your device at first   very happy with this and will use it to strengthen the signal for our ring doorbell now that christmas is done      
517,5.0 ,                       i ve had connectivity issues with my home wifi for   years and was at my wits end with weak signal even next to my router  setup was sort of a task since i didn t remember my router s password or the type of wifi security that was being used  i set it up   years ago  after    minutes and trying all possibilities   i got the range extender to work  instructions were clear on where to set it up and i wish i had purchased this years ago  using download   upload speed apps  my speed doubled  in theory this doesn t make sense because the router has to output the higher signal  but i only assume a setting or not resetting often enough created a sort of clog connecting devices to both networks  original ssid and ssid   the extender wifi signal was stronger and faster  even though it s an upstairs bedroom  i still get a better signal if i m in the basement  i would recommend this product very highly      
518,5.0 ,                       this device got me exactly what i wanted  a stronger  reliable signal in my upstairs bedroom surprisingly  the quick start guide failed to mention that it is a good idea to hook the device to your router with an ethernet cable while connecting to the web browser based set up  step one suggests that you connect using a network manager on your computer or wifi device  doing this will likely make it unnecessary to use an ethernet cable   if you don t do this  you can easily connect by using an ethernet cable from your router to the range extender  the quick start manual doesn t mention the ethernet cable option  just the wifi connect option  once connected and set up  you can and should disconnect the ethernet cable  i didn t use any of the help features such as chat or phone calls  but they seem to be readily available if needed there were a few glitches and tense moments at first but the device is now stable and working as expected      
519,1.0 ,                       i hate this thing  right now i m stuck with it  but will be buying a different one when i can  think you re playing it safe by getting a recognizable brand like netgear  think again it drops constantly  resetting it usually fixes the problem  but the fix is always brief and it always inevitably drops again  usually within       minutes  sometimes it will drop in as little as one minute  and sometimes an hour if you re really lucky  but one thing is guaranteed  and that is that it will always drop soon  it has never not dropped  it is like a law of nature that this thing will eventually drop connection for seemingly no reason at all with no warning  no slowdown  just one second it works  next second it does not  and it seems to be getting worse and i have had it for less than a year  it is rage inducing  if you like being ripped off and making constant trips to turn something off and on again go ahead and buy this piece of junk      
520,1.0 ,                       terrible app  great idea for the price  wants you to just plug and play  it isn t that easy  the app has   stars  and it wants you to login to your router using only  admin   i get having to login to the router using the modem router ip but   security  who owns this app  there is virtually no tech support  it may work for other netgear devices but  these things promise miracles and i just realized it s all fantasy  just spend the extra     and get a new modem router  fixed  if you have another name for your router it won t let you login  i reset my router   times and tried to login using the app  using different passwords for my router   no work  sucks  plugged in nice though      
521,1.0 ,                       the first months  during the return window  this worked like a charme  it extended my wifi network from the second floor to the first with no issues  the second month i noticed a lost of range from green light to orange all the time  so i moved it closer to the router  about    days later same issue so i had to move it even closer  and no the problem was not the router itself   wherei mover it has been working but then it doesn t extend the wifi as far as i want it but at least the green light has been persistent   rd month of use and my smart switches give me about      offline  alerts a day  only the ones connected to this extender  i have to restart the extender every time  if i don t restart it devices can t connect to it because  incorrect password  but obviously the password has not changed  after restarting the device the password  magically  works again  so for a life span of    months you are better off buying another one spend a little bit more money and get yourself something that will work more than   months      
522,5.0 ,                       i was looking for an extender to hook my security cameras and work place  instead of rewiring  i was able to use this to extend wifi coverage to the corners and also connect them to security cameras setup  easy to setup  either as extender or access point  creates   wireless networks     ghz and  ghz   allows you to configure which wifi frequency to use for the ethernet port   disable enable access point names ui  web access is pretty much what i use  i can monitor connected devices  ability to change settings of the wireless network  access control  and setup modify the settings other  has couple of buttons on the device  which allows us to turn on off the device  reset the network   settings usage  i use both wifi network and a single ethernet port on the device  both are pretty usable overall  pretty happy with the device and gives a good speed to my devices      
523,5.0 ,                       very easy and uncomplicated to set up  it improved the signal strength by    percent with the router being in the apartment next to mine  wood walls        it has a rj   jack on the bottom of it so you can connect a device to it via a network cable  in fact you can connect a    hub to it and connect several devices to it via network cable     great      tech  support for    days if you need it     
524,5.0 ,                       wow  i never owned a range extender before this and i never knew what i was missing  this thing is superb  the range on this extender is almost better than my actual router  also netgear   no more issues with quality switching on netflix  transfer speed between computers is also quite good  not as good as being next to the router  but you know    better than being in low signal  i never knew how much of a difference  one bar  could actually make in network quality until this also  as a bonus  i have a wifi drone  car style  with camera and when i configure this extender to match the drones wifi i can drive it around the entire house without any lost signal or video issues easily one of my favorite tech purchases this year  very  very pleased      
525,3.0 ,                       i was very excited to try the wi fi extended  i followed instructions and the only place the extender shows green lights is   feet from the modem   even then it should extend the wi fi to the rest of the house i would think  it is a small house   in case it is helping and we just cannot tell  we decided to keep it  there is no tech support that i know of but i will read the instructions again in case we missed something      
526,2.0 ,                       i have a nighthawk x  with one bedroom it cannot reach well   had high hopes  but this extender would only connect at  g half way up the hall   on a speed test  it got worse than my main router  and it s dbm  power  only improved if i was sitting right next to the device   from the room    feet away  it got    dbm worse   i only gave this a two instead of a one so if you if you would read this   very disappointed on this one      
527,1.0 ,                       i will never again buy from netgear  went to the netgear site listed in the instructions booklet  device not detected  so i contacted tech support from the netgear page  this is what i got after letting a tech share my screen   let me ask my manager if i can fix this for a nominal fee  i was already on guard because the tech had instructed me to another netgear site and my browser warned me it was a possible attack site  spent about    minutes on the phone with the tech who  eventually  explained something or other needed to be cleaned up and an ip firewall installed     and you know a tech will have to come to your home and you will have to pay a lot for that   oh no  sure enough  sales pitch followed  offer to  fix it  for       i said i d ask the it agents at work what to do and hung up i will put this item in the electronics recycling pile  past return date  can t give it away for fear someone else will get scammed  what is going on with your tech dept netgear      
528,1.0 ,                       like many others i am working from home  i bought this extender because my router is in my living room and my home office is upstairs  i plugged my ethernet cord in this extender and sometimes worked however  many times it didn t  it randomly shut off multiple times  and its basic unreliable  if you are working from home do not buy this      
529,5.0 ,                       i plugged it in and pressed the wps button and then on my ipad went to the mywifiext net site and answered a few questions and it created   extra networks to my already existing network the   extra networks have the ending  gext and  gext the  gext seems much stronger so i connected in settings my ipad to the  gext and also connected my phone and laptop in settings to the new extended network using my original password for my netgear router modem combo  works great i didn t have to use the wps button on my router combo   so when i look at my list of available networks in settings i now have   instead of     so as a non techy person of average ability i am pleased that i now have all my bars blazing even at the back of my small home  which of course i didn t have before  when i plugged the extender in the wall the power went on automatically and i only as mentioned earlier pressed the wps button on the extender   i have had success with netgear products my router combo is about   years old and going strong  i have spectrum internet if that is of any help so no incompatibility problem      
530,1.0 ,                       bought these to extend the range of my netgear wireless router  i reviewed the specs to ensured they were compatible with the router  i couldn t get them to connect with the router so i called the netgear technical support number  after a few attempts i got through and they charged me        for support  more then the price of the two extenders   ok  i was willing to pay it  but after two attempts they couldn t make it work  had to return them and i am out         online reviews indicate these are very difficult to install  i suggest you take care to ensure you have the know how before trying to install one      
531,5.0 ,                       over all i m happy with it  i did have to watch a few youtube videos on setting it up  i read the little book that came with it  had issues getting it set up  after i did a  factory reset  by pushing the little button on the side of it i didn t have any issues with set up after that  i was able to set this up with my iphone    i did set this up as a  access point  by using a ethernet cable  quite happy how to do factory resetplug extender inwait for the light to go from amber to greenthen push and hold reset button until light turns amber then flashesonce is flashes let off button and wait for the green light to come back on      
532,3.0 ,                       we have a fairly large one story house  laid out like an  l   our internet comes in near the top of the l  and that s where our wifi router is  we had one room near tip of the boot with no wifi signal  so we figured we would put this in the living room  at the corner  and fix the problem   we have good signal to our devices in the living room  but where we first tried the extender in the living room it didn t get signal  we found another spot where it did get signal  most of the time   about    feet from the router  with no walls in the way  and usually it supplies our dead room well  but not always      
533,5.0 ,                       i tried this out because i live in a guesthouse  with the wifi router in the main house  and was only able to get a weak signal in one portion of my living space  with this installed  i get a pretty strong signal everywhere in the guesthouse  it s not the fastest internet i ve seen  but it s so much better than it was  it was very easy to set up  and i m no computer wiz  i m relieved and thankful for this relatively cheap option that has made a huge difference in my living space      
534,5.0 ,                       netgear to the rescue again  i can t get over how amazing this little powerhouse extends my routers s signal  i own   floors of living space in my condex  my mom owns the other side  which is where the router is  on her second floor  in the northeast corner of the room  i cut the cable cord   years ago and have fire sticks on   tvs throughout my house   mom cave  bottom floor   living room  kitchen  second floor  and master suite  third floor  and i get a very good signal in all parts of the house  where the verizon extender only gives me a good signal and hasta be hard wired with cables running everywhere this is the best electronics purchase i ve made since my kindle fire hdx  super easy to set up and i can return the    month pos to verizon      
535,5.0 ,                       great solution to my networking woes  push button set up with wps and it bypassed the heat pump in my condo which was causing me to lose signal on the opposite end of the house  the device can only support up to    devices  but i only have one apple tv on it to stream content  as soon as it was joined  i saw an instant improvement and haven t had an issue since i don t generally recommend range extenders  but i am very happy with this one      
536,2.0 ,                       i had high hopes for this product but ultimately they fell short  this may be bumped up to a   star review in some peoples eyes  the issue i had with this device was not that it did not boost my wifi at the selected location  it worked well in that area  which is why it might be   stars for some  the issue i ran into was that it had an effect on the wifi at other locations in my house  for example  in my room  the wifi used to be great but when i was on the original wifi   not the extended wifi  it was significantly slower and many times my devices would not automatically connect to the wifi  i returned this and got a lan cable and it worked much better  for much less      
537,5.0 ,                       i m not an it person but i found the instructions to be clear and not difficult to follow   this extender works great     so    now i can sit in my living room and get  gig in what was previously a dead spot   not even my    mb would give me enough signal   now i have four networks all with the same password   the two original networks and the two from the extender   just got it today  unpacked it  and had it operating in    minutes without ever doing this kind of thing before   hopefully it continues to be flawless         
538,5.0 ,                       i ve had no issues with the netgear wifi range extender ex     once i successfully installed it   details of my experience   i was pleasantly surprised that several of my streaming devices actually received better speeds when connected to the extender even though the devices were closer in distance to my base hub   for those times when i ve lost my internet connection the extender has automatically reconnected to the cable modem once the internet connection was re established   btw   i m using a cable modem wifi all in one combo provided by comast  having both  g    g is handy since several of my smart bulbs only work with  g and won t configure to a  g network  initial installation   in my case i wasn t able to perform the initial extender configuration to my cable modem wirelessly so i finally resorted to connecting the extender directly to a cable modem port via ethernet cable   once the installation and configuration was complete i disconnected the ethernet cable and moved the extender to the desired wall socket where it has worked flawlessly as a wireless extender since      
539,2.0 ,                       i was having trouble setting up my extender  when a chat screen popped up  the person   or computer  on the other end gave me all the stock suggestions from the quick start guide  then finally said that a technician would call me within   minutes  ok  i m along for the ride  a person called me whose primary language was not my own  but i m still cool with it  he says in order to connect the extender  he needs to access my computer  hmmm  ok  i ll watch whats happening  right  so i agree  next he says that i don t have a firewall and that my computer ip address is being used my people all over the world and that s why my extender won t connect  too much traffic  i ask him   what are you trying to tell me  is this where you ask me for money   he starts into a dialogue about how they need to remove all the intruders one by one and it s my fault  not theirs  and that is when i told him we were done  suddenly  the line went dead  i couldn t turn my computer off fast enough i did get the extender connected  on my own  finally  did it help  no  my actual signal is slower than it was at the end of the house i needed it for bottom line  after all of this  i feel violated and unsafe  i ll be scanning my computer tonight for any possible bugs that the  support person  may have planted  not worth it        
540,2.0 ,                       i purchased this device thinking it would be an easy set up   plug and play   it was completely the opposite i plugged the device in the wall and went to read the instructions on how to get it connected to my router   the url provided directed me to a site with no install links or anything but oddly there was an      to call for assistance   i m thinking it was netgears tech support  it wasn t   it was security suite company who checked my computer and advised that they were unable to install the device due to the foreign ip addresses that needed to be removed   once removed then the device could be connected   sounds easy right   no   the tech goes on and on about the possible threats on the computer and outside traffic and recommends that a firewall is needed and goes on to offer firewall security     year for      or      for a lifetime   i refused and all of the sudden the price changes to        year or      lifetime yes   i opted for the   year and now the device is up and running fine but i m really having second thoughts about this   i just been bamboozalled   or was i it just wasn t right though   amazon advertises this device on sale for a great price but it really cost      i have   days to cancel and am really considering it   hell   my internet provider provides a security suite for free and it has firewall now i m even more pissed now     
541,4.0 ,                       it was easy enough to set up but i dont feel like i got any extension to the signal in my house  main router in livingroom  put this in a bed room just a wall away and signal is just the same  as amatter of fact it drops now more than it did before  i probably need more than one  uverse signal not so great in my bldg sometimes  good price  sturdy construction  could be something i did      
542,5.0 ,                       if you have an ac wifi router with the  gz band the extender is fast enough to work with a tivo mini   i had a previous wifi bridge on the     band that wasn t fast enough to handle the tivo mini and it would shut down after a few minutes with some kind of  not fast enough  error message   this one has the speed to handle all the functions of the hard wired tivo and a simultaneous wireless connection   it also does not shut itself off to save energy  as some of the powerline extenders do  so the tivo mini doesn t lose its connection the extender is    feet from my main router  linksys ac      and on the other side of a kitchen wall with kitchen cabinets  a range  and a microwave in between   happy with it so far jwk     
543,3.0 ,                       i m a developer  and i end up working from home a lot  i m often in virtual meetings  on calls  sharing screen  or simply uploading content to a cloud network or github  with that  i need a stable connection  my office  of all places  has severe interference and almost all wifi signals in the house drop in and out  constantly  i never had a stable connection  so  i decided that  since i have decent netgear nighthawk router  i d get a netgear wifi range extender  this has essentially solved my connection dropouts completely   but with a few caveats  below are the pros and cons i have found   some of which may be deal breakers for you pros    easy to install   the instructions are a bit vague  but if you can follow the first step   which is plugging it in  then connecting to the default ssid on your laptop   you can then follow the instructions on the wizard that pops up on your screen after doing so    small   seems obvious  but this does make for a nice discrete extender  my router is quite bulky  and i don t have a ton of space to store more devices  so i really like how small this thing is    mostly stable   even in my  dead  office that blocks most wifi signals  i was able to find a good middle ground spot that allows me to get reasonable signal cons    huge speed decrease as you move further away  this may sound obvious  but this is actually pretty significant  it has great range  but you have to be within   feet to get similar speeds you may already get being    feet away from your router  for example  my router is on the first floor of our home  and my bedroom is right above it  my extender literally is just outside my room  standing within     feet of the extender  my laptop gets a decent        mbps  standing    feet away from it  or in my bedroom  it drops all the way down to   mbps  whereas the router  which is on another floor  maintains the    mbps    the connection is stable  but the speed is not  running multiple speed tests shows my download speed drop substantially momentarily before rising back up again  it never completely disconnects  but will loose     of the speed for a few seconds  if you re like me  and you only needed this for work and day to day tasks  you probably won t notice the drop  but if you re a gamer who plays  say  first person shooters online  you may encounter lag and skipped frames  or  if you re watching movies  you may lose some quality in the image    the instruction booklet is not very useful past the first couple pages  the information is somewhat inconsistent with what actually needs to be done conclusion if you re like me and you simply need a basic  stable  wireless connection  this will do the trick  however  if you re hoping to maintain your download speeds  you may need to look elsewhere  you may be better off buying an ac adapter  that converts wall power into a somwhat direct ethernet cat  connection between your device and router   and either plugging your computer directly into that  or plugging in an additional router or hotspot to that  it d be a bit more expensive  but would work  this is definitely not for gamers or for streaming high definition movies i have to say  for what i needed it for  it s perfect  i am somewhat disappointed  though  in the speed distance performance impact  for this price point        i d expect better      
544,4.0 ,                       i m no tech wizard  but i m generally pretty handy  and somewhat tech savvy   installed this on the top floor of a three story      sq ft  home  at the top of the stairs  basically as close as possible to the verizon fios router      mbps service  in the family room on the second floor while still being useful for the top floor   install was a breeze   i conducted numerous speed tests and it cuts the speed basically in half  on average  but still works just fine    for me   this is only on my non apple devices  lg v   phone  desktop pc with wifi  and a relatively new lenovo laptop    my wife s apple products  iphone  s and ipad air  have serious issues connecting to the wifi  but especially through the extender   i am not sure i blame the extender  but we re going to try another  more expensive faster speed rated  one to see if that helps   for the price  it gets the job done for me  a non fruit user  but not for apple products      
545,5.0 ,                       i don t normally review things  but this extender works so incredibly well  my trouble was i had gotten sick of renting a modem router so i purchased what i thought was a good modem router   an arris surfboard sbg      i paid like      for it  so i thought it was good  it wasn t  even though i was getting   mbps when i was wired directly to the modem  i was only getting   mbps standing right next to it on wifi  it made streaming on netflix annoying at times because of how terrible the wifi was  enter the netgear ac     i don t know why people had a hard time setting this up  it s very easy if you follow the instructions  i set it up as an extender  not as a access point  but still   it took me about    minutes  one very cool feature about this device is that it broadcasts simultaneously in     and   ghz  this lets you choose which network to use if you have older devices that don t  support  ghz  my router only broadcasts in either     or  ghz  somehow  the netgear is able to still broadcast in  ghz even though my router is set to      not sure how this works  but it s a good thing  bottom line  this thing solved all my network problems  i was afraid i was going to have to move my router to a more central location which would have required me to get under the house and run wires  this saved me time and money  if i could give it more stars i would        
546,5.0 ,                       so far so good   came today and i immediately began to install   we live in a      sq foot house and it seemed that the router  netgear nighthawk model  did not cover the wide reaches of the house   installed this and it appears that the signal is better   hope that the tv link to the router is stronger as well     
547,5.0 ,                       my fiance installed it  you just have to know your wifi password and create another name for your location it can be the same just add a number  i haven t had any issues so i m happy      
548,5.0 ,                       i got this for my son who is renting a house in a dense urban area for college  when i searched networks with my phone  i ve never seen so much traffic  coverage throughout the house was impossible and the students need it  plugged it into a power outlet  and pushed the wps button on router and extender  per instructions   when the lights stopped flashing  unplugged and moved upstairs to a new power outlet and now full coverage throughout the whole house for everyone  easy  no configuration or computer necessary  been   months of heavy use with no trouble  but my son has had to unplug and plug back in a couple of times  maybe the hurricane that hit him had something to do with it     very good  inexpensive device just works  especially in high traffic environments      
549,1.0 ,                       it is really annoying to receive a lemon so to speak  it didnt work at all i followed the instructions about ten times just to make sure it wasn t me  in any of the vague instructions did anything work  the site supposedly can t be reached  so i couldn t do anything  long story short it didn t work and the worst part is now i have to go out of my way to send this expensive paper weight back i won t be doing business with these people ever again      
550,3.0 ,                       i would have rated this product a   star however  it does work as designed   the big secret is that although it does extend your wireless signal quite well  it cuts your internet speed in half  so if you are getting    mbps from your router directly  you would get roughly   mbps when connecting to this device  and yes  it does say this somewhere in the paperwork  but should be more appropriately disclosed up front  device description says it is capable of speeds up to     mbps  which is probably true  but very misleading      
551,5.0 ,                       it is not as easy to install as they say  it has to be synced to the router before you can use it to extend the wi fi range to be picked up in other areas  if you have computers and printers on a network in various areas in a house  they will receive the wi fi signal fine  tvs with roku and streaming and other electronics will not receive it as well and so a range extender is the answer  you may have to call for tech support  i didn t have to because my son helped me and he is well versed in electronics  networks  etc      
552,2.0 ,                       once you decipher the poorly written instructions it is actually quite easy to install  however  i am not experiencing much improvement at all with the extender  i have run several tests and even consulted with one of our work engineers  i work in a  post production house   this wifi extender did not improve the signal in the room that i was hoping it would help  by the way the room is only about     ft away and i have strategically located the extender between the actual router and the room with no change  maybe you ll have better luck   i cannot recommend it      
553,5.0 ,                       when it arrived and i took it out of the box i thought it was broken because the manual and directions kind of suck because to do the step by step directions don t work right  it took some trial and error to figure it out because i thought i had a bad extender out of the box  st thing you want to do is plug it into an outlet right next to your main router and what that does is let s them sync up to each other  nd thing you want to do when the extender power button is solid green is push the wps button on your main router until it s blinking and then push the wps button on the extender  rd thing you should see the lights on the extender light up on the router  power  and wps the device light will stay unlit until you try and log into the extender click your wifi settings and you will see a new    ghz and a  ghz and those are your new ones that are broadcast through the extender i know this is confusing but you need to enter your password that you use on your internet provider on the new extender and log into it and try both the    ghz and the  ghz and save both of them and you should see the device light on the extender light up to green when you have done the complete install with the wps feature on your main router then you ready to move it to the other side of the house but don t move it to far because you mighy not get a strong signal  mine is about   ft from my main router and it covers this old stone wall farmhouse perfect the last thing you want to do is hit the wps button on your router again and hit the wps button on the extender again and if there within a good distance of each other and all lights are green then you should be up and running but if there not green then you will have to move it closer to your main router if your main router doesn t have a wps option  on it then you might have to call netgear online support to help you out because i didn t find another way to install it correctly another thing is if the power ever does go our just sync them back up with the wps button and wait like  mins and it will work again because you already did all the setup i leave mine on      and it runs a little warm here and there but that s normal and i have never had any issues except power outages from thunder storms hope this helps someone else but every internet providers router might be different but i m using the new comcast router on the triple play with the works      
554,4.0 ,                       just so every one understands how this works  it splits your signal in half  so if you have a    mps  the extender creates   channels at      mps each  it works well and if you have wps on your router it is easy to set up  i tried to set it up manually and could not get through the instructions without a hang up  so you need to be a little tech savvy  it does do the job  i have it connected to a camera door bell  and a smart tv      
555,5.0 ,                       edit          i ve had this for about   weeks tl dr  it still works it works well    i ve tried both the  ghz    ghz extenders  they work well in my   story house  i ve noticed that the  ghz frequency is always at     bars on my iphone  although  it is still stable  the  ghz is consistently at     bars  i ve had the  ghz drop for a few minutes one time  but i dunno if that s a  fluke  or something that can be blamed on at t  we can all agree that any   everything can be blamed on at t    screw at t  but i digress   screw at t            original review i got the ac    wifi extender  model ex      i use it to extend the radius of our modem  it s a terrible modem in a terrible location of the house   it works well  as the title suggests  i haven t had this for long  time will tell if it lasts it has the option to extend both the  ghz and  ghz frequencies if your modem has it  mine does   i tried both connections  both work  the  ghz connection is weaker  even when one room away  it picks up     bars on my phone  the  ghz  however  is     bars everywhere the instructions in the  quick start  manual were clear   accurate  i had no trouble  it requires no app or account to set up  i have it plugged into an outlet in the center of the house on the  nd floor  the modem is also on the second floor one room away oh  you can also use the cat  plug as the source for the device to extend  i have not tried this  it is impractical for us  we only have one cable per room   but it is an option detailed in the guide like i said  i ve not had it long  but  i d recommend it      
556,3.0 ,                       bought this to get wifi into an office where the wifi signal from our router doesn t penetrate without having to lay an ethernet cable the setup with wps is painless and the signal reasonably strong the bad part is that the repeater fairly frequently loses signal from the router  regardless of where i plug it in  this creates problems when your child is trying to do on line school  also  the bandwidth goes down considerably  i ended up running an ethernet cable to the office and setting up an older router as ap  giving me   to   times the wifi speed of the repeater i would not buy this again      
557,5.0 ,                       i just installed a outdoor tv and speakers for our pool  i noticed that sitting in the pool     feet from the house and about    from there router in my home that signal was weak and sometimes with just drop or run very slowly  and we have a high end netgear router   i bought this and installed it right inside the back door   closest outlet to the pool    problem solved  i can sit in the pool and adjust the tv   receiver  hell everything we need to  great solution for         
558,5.0 ,                       i have a mesh network with  ghz and    ghz signals but the same id  for cheap items such as wifi wall plugs and cameras that require a    ghz only dedicated id  i needed something to push my    ghz signal on a visible id  centrally located in my home and no drops to any upstairs or downstairs devices needing the    ghz signal      
559,5.0 ,                       it took a bit longer to install  i ve got abrick wall to contend with and i have three interior walls as well  i found that the connection at the end point was weak with the device  but  after several trials i found the sweet spot that pipes to the far end of the house  now i have uninterrupted wifi in the bedroom  netflix bingeing may now begin      
560,4.0 ,                       better than i expected  works great for the price  i liked the two different options for connecting  it s a bit convoluted set up that seems unnecessary  i have a metal building that blocks the wifi signal to the rv outside  i placed it in a crack of the doorway where one antenna is inside and the device antenna is outside  the antennas aren t removable  but i basically set the unit at the best line of sight i could get on both sides of the metal  and ran an extension cord to it  i connect devices in the rv about     away from this unit  and the unit is about     from the cable modem inside another room in the metal building  it is currently only plugged in to the outlet  not ethernet  it does drop in speed some  but very useable   actually about the same speed i had with the prior isp   netgear customer support tells me the speed should be better if i hardwire it with an ethernet cable  but i haven t tried that yet because i didn t want to run another line through the inside wall to the cable modem  it was a lot cheaper than the other equipment they recommended for a couple hundred that would have to be hardwired  the next model would probably have been even better and still a good price  but this one is serving it s purpose  the building isn t climate controlled  but the unit is out of the weather  it has worked through the winter  hope this makes sense to help someone  i couldn t find much in reviews to help me make a decision on purchase for my needs  this worked well      
561,1.0 ,                       my ancient extender was having problems so i bought this one   setup is adequate for a consumer product   the throughput is marginal   my cable speed is listed as       but i usually get           i have a good signal to the headend router that s about    feet away in the house but my speed after a series of tests is     down and    up on     ghz   that s barely adequate did a firmware update   ran a long ping test to google com   times were        ms with a average of    with a    loss   average ping time for my other network which uses the same cable modem is and another router is   ms with lost packets less than        still not good      
562,1.0 ,                       i bought this   months ago and i d return it now if i could  if it s not been used in the last    minutes  you have to restart it  not reconnect it to your router but hit the power button  wait    seconds then turn it back on  and then it s another minute or two for it to fully boot up i have reset it completely   times  i have reconnected it to my router more than that  i ve done everything support has suggested and nothing works  all i get in the end is that it must be a weak connection  if it was a weak connection  this extender wouldn t pick it up at all     it s like it goes into sleep mode when not in use and you have to restart entirely to get it to wake up worthless      
563,1.0 ,                       first one that arrived bricked during the update once i got it hooked up  customer service is obviously off shore customer service and it is very apparent that they are not technical at all and are simply reading from a script amazon customer service was very quick to ship a replacement   unfortunately when i received the replacement it would say it was broadcasting in        but i could not get a connection to the      i tried with multiple devices  two android phones  android tablet  and a laptop    so  back to customer service  this person was even less skilled than the first person i spoke with  they wanted me to set my router back to factory default  why should i have to that when the problem is with their device  i can connect to my router s     with no problem  the customer service agent said that it must be an issue with the hardware and said i would need to send it back  that would make it the third device  so i asked for a higher tier of support  this was going to be a call back sometime within    hours  who can wait around their house for    hours to wait for a call back fortunately i was able to resolve the issue on my own with some trouble shooting skills  however  the extender offers no better signal than my router it s supposed to be extending  i tried several areas of the house with no luck from the number of high star reviews i am surprised that the product performs as poorly as it does the killer for me on top of the poor product performance was the very poor customer service  and that phone call that was supposed to be within    hours never happened ordered a google mesh system and the difference is astounding  guess you get what you pay for      
564,5.0 ,                       setup was simple with the enclosed instructions  seriously easy i bought this for my garage when i have my nvr set up  which requires a network signal for remote monitoring this extender handels my  k video signal without any issues i can monitor my home while at work or anywhere with an internet connection  no rating for tech support as i have not had the need for it      
565,3.0 ,                       i had purchased this to hopefully help the wireless network in my house  single story ranch style under     sqft  and had nothing but problems when trying to use this device  i am not a network engineer that works for a fortune     pc peripheral company but i am tech savvy and this item item didn t work as i had hope for  i also noticed that this device had gotten really warm under normal usage  being plugged into the wall     and because of that i also decided not to use this device  now  for someone else s setup this may work perfectly fine but again not for my setup  some may question where i had installed plugged this device in for the network when reading this review and it was out in the open  not surrounded by walls furniture and was less than   ft from the wireless router  i ended up just using an existing router and putting it into wireless repeater mode on the opposite end of the house and works just fine      
566,5.0 ,                       surprised by how well this works  in the g kid s room about     from the router  i have added a new smart tv and the wifi just can t quite support it at that range  i put this about     from my router in order to extend the signal another     to that tv  it actually didn t change much  i was disappointed but tried a different way  i moved this device to that very weakest area about     away at the other end of the house  this worked gangbusters  i don t understand  truly  but it worked well and continues months later  i can now also use the wifi outside which was impossible before  power outage  router down  isp  cable  down  none of these events have caused this thing to even bobble  i have not had to so much as  touch  it since install  it automatically resumes reconnects reboots  it just always works  transparently  unattended      
567,1.0 ,                       i should have known this was going to be another bad product from netgear  the reviews sounded so good  burned again by them  as i had purchased an older version of this wifi extender a few years ago  so  it looks like the quality is still poor  the amazon description of this wifi extender said reception was up to      sq  ft  but it didn t even pick up a signal    feet away from the router  when it did work  it would take so long for a website to load  or else once a page was loaded  you then got the annoying circling buffering  i contacted customer support  what a joke   they re answer to everything is factory reset  sure  after i spent over a half hour getting it installed and trying to connect the device to mywifiext net  so  i did the reset and lo and behold  the same problem  no improvement   i asked if the signal channel could be switched to different one from the router and other surrounding wifi s  she had to ask someone and they said no  channels are fixed  it seemed like she was reading from a script  as she kept repeating the same thing  plus she was not in america  and so it was difficult to understand her  mind you  i speak   languages  so i am used to accents   luckily  i was able to return the piece of junk and get a refund     i suggest that anyone looking to improve wifi reception  buy a mesh wifi system like eero or google nest  this system provides much better  farther and more consistent wifi reception      
568,2.0 ,                       criticism is not directed towards product  it was an easy setup  the repeater covering areas of the house where wifi reception is poor  it improved signal to my ring doorbell   the repeater i received was obviously used  see pictures  spots  stains   i ordered new  not used or refurb  unfortunatly i needed it immedeately for sick family member who is using the bedroom with poor signal so i opted to keep the one i got  not happy about it update           noticing a lot of signal drops  even less happy when it disconnects  does not maitain connection     
569,4.0 ,                       this product does the job  if that job is to only extend the internet  it does not increase the speed  i get    mbps from my isp  i plugged my ps  into my router via ethernet and got     mbps  my ps  has to be in a different room though  and wireless it only gets    mbps  i used this and plugged my ps  into this product via ethernet  and only got     mbps  my switch can connect wirelessly to  g  so it gets    mbps in the same room  i plugged in my switch to this product via ethernet and i got an average of    mbps so in summary  this will certainly extend your network  but it will in no way increase the speed as if the device was either right next to the main router or plugged into the main router via ethernet  given the price  not too surprised in their defense      
570,5.0 ,                       i was hesitant to purchase this extender due to all the one and two star negative reviews  with ny city shut down because of covid    i am currently working from home  nice weather approaching i d like to work in my yard  but my router  in my basement  doesn t get wifi out that far  so i thought i d give this extender a shot  homerun people   i m no techie but my goodness  took me all of   minutes to set extender up  followed all directions  took my laptop out to backyard patio  and that is where i am typing this review from  works like a charm for me       
571,4.0 ,                       this extended my wireless router s signal very significantly  the wireless router is located in my office in the first floor  before this extender  signal to my backyard and second floor rooms was very weak      bars at best  then after i installed this unit  it s going full bar strength  the   star rating is only due to the heat that it generates  the extender seems to run hot  other than the heat  seems like a good buy      
572,2.0 ,                       i purchased two of the aforementioned wifi extenders  one was installed in garage  outside  the second was installed in living room  signal strength was weak from living room to my bedroom  which is approximately    ft  from where wifi extender is plugged in  further  the unit loses connectivity on an intermittent basis  the second wifi extender is approximately    ft  from the router      
573,4.0 ,                       i am a long time it network guy and i ran into and issue that is not documented well  other than in some of the forums   it took me a few hours to research  so hopefully this will save you some time   the only reason for   stars vs   is it had only been up and running for a day and the documentation could use some work although the setup wizard and manual are pretty straight forward  they forgot to include a key piece for troubleshooting   i have an asus rt   u router and i use mac filtering for    and  g bands   you cannot have this enabled and use the extender   although they give you   diff mac addresses  that i tried to add to my filter table  it did not work as it should as it supposedly virtualizes your real mac address to a variant of that in the extender you will know that mac filtering is your issue because it will connect tot he extender  but will show  no internet connection  and you will not get a dhcp address  but instead it will start with a     x x x default address when dhcp can not be obtained once i disabled my mac filtering  all is good and i still have decent aes encryption in place      
574,1.0 ,                          mb speed claim is misleading  they are combining the     and   bands  since when does a computer connect both     and   at the same time  also  the interface is terrible  you cannot manage it directly without network cloud so you need internet access before you can config this device  also  this device already failed after a year for me  just not a good product overall  clunky menu design  lack of configuration features  misleading cliams  netgeat seems to have fallen very short in the last couple of years      
575,2.0 ,                       i wanted this to set up a existing security camera system to my wifi because it has to be plugged in but is not near my router  one wall in between    so the problem that i failed to notice is that it is a ether net plug and not usb   so in order to connect to my monitor i needed a adapter ether net to usb  also  set up was a bit more involved that i would have hoped   i would have loved plug and play but that did not happen   i wanted to create a new user name and pw for     and   but it defaulted to my existing modem name even though i set it up with new names and pws  it did not accept them and defaulted to the modem names so i kept trying to sign in and couldn t figure out for a while why it would not let me   no matter what i did it would not let me change them to new names and pws   i have set up my fair share of routers and extenders and never had a issue like i did with this one   i tried to call support but could never get anyone on the line after literally    minutes of waiting on hold   i emailed the company and again no response   finally  the range on this is not great   it is not far from my router but it tends to drop the signal often   not impressed      
576,5.0 ,                       this unit was easy to set up  i did have to visit the website for specific instructions  which  would expect anyway  and the instructions were clear and simple  even for someone as old and tech ignorant as myself  now we get a wifi signal as strong in the farthest room of the house as we right next to the modem  cheap  simple  effective  no need to say more      
577,5.0 ,                       for some reason  my daughter s bedroom was the one place in our house that our wifi could not reach  even after upgrading the fios router to their extended reach version  nothing worked  my daughter is a teenager and is by far the biggest bandwidth hog in our house  so our data usage was getting maxed out by the middle of each month because of her  finally  i bought this netgear range extender as a sort of  hail mary  attempt at fixing our issue  for the price i paid  i figured it had no chance of working  but i followed the steps to set it up  very easy by the way  and plugged it into the hallway outside our bedrooms  thinking it was a good spot to reach the fios router and my daughter s room  when the extender is working  it shows up as a new wifi network  with a similar name to your existing one  well  my daughter connected to the new network and has not dropped off one time while she is in her room  and we ve had this device in place for over six months  it s slightly bulky when plugged into an outlet  but really only slightly larger than an adapter that you would use for your kindle device  so not too bad  but it is without a doubt worth every penny  this is one of the best purchases i have made on amazon      
578,1.0 ,                       absolute waste of money  i m fairly tech savy  but far from an expert  instructions  there are none  looked on the internet and found some decent information  going thru all of it  the signal for our kindles  phones and the were worse with this extender  than with it  we have a better router which is fine  it s just that we need a signal that can go about     feet thru normal walls  will be spending money to buy something else  will use the other one quickly in case i have to return it  save your money for something better      
579,4.0 ,                       ex     review   i originally started with the cheap tplink because i have a small      sf place and didn t need much  but i get interference from who knows where  so i needed a booster extender   the tplink was awful  so i returned it   the ex     works amazing and is easy to use  except it has intermittent service interruptions   this only happens maybe once or twice a day  because i think it overheats   i returned it twice for a new one and it does the same thing every time without fail   you just have to unplug and plug it back in to reset and your good for another     day  usually    i sometimes throw it in the freezer because it s hot and that makes it last longer   the service is amazing for the price    mbps   ghz  no problem  my service tops at    mbps for reference   it will frustrate you overtime if you work from home or use it for extended periods of time   i still think it s great for the price and want to give it five     stars  but because of the service interruptions it s a four     star      
580,4.0 ,                       this product relays the signal with sufficiently for streaming hd video content at a slightly reduced strength scenario  we have a   br apartment with concrete walls partitioning the bed room and living room  the router is in the living space  the concrete walls reduce the router s signal strength in the bed room to nearly zero  preventing even loading the google domain in a mobile browser results  we placed the device at the intersection of the hallway leading to the br and the hallway leading to the living room  we positioned the device antenna s to receive signal directly from the router and direct the extension network through the bed room door  directly at our roku tv  the extension network signal picked up by the roku tv is slightly less strong but sufficient for streaming titles on netflix without quality deterioration  keep in mind  we have the highest speed internet package provided by xfinity  so i m unsure of the quality given a weaker slower root signal conclusion  very happy with our purchase as it satisfies our needs for an affordable price  i believe the adjustable antennas are invaluable for ours and most other people s purposes  as it directs the network in the desired direction  without this  we may have needed two of the cheaper devices without adjustable antennas  we have had this for less than a month  so i cannot attest to durability  my only caveat with this device is that the antennas rotate on a single axis  meaning that we cannot adjust them directly outward from the side of the device  as if it were on a ball bearing  but simply in a     degree arc parallel to the device when  standing up       
581,5.0 ,                       my bedroom and my internet router are the furthest possible distance away from each other  they re on opposite levels of the house  on opposite sides  thus  the internet speeds in my room prior to this extender were almost unbearable it was a bit of a pain to set up because i kept running into problems with my router s firewall not letting the extender connect  not the extender s fault though   in the end  i finally got it working and boy  what an improvement after initial setup in the room where the router is  i put the extender in my room before  the  ghz band could not reach my room  so i had to use    ghz  i had about     signal strength on    ghz  and was lucky to get    p video on youtube  i was getting   or   down    or   up now  i get both the    ghz and  ghz bands  and i have      signal strength on both  i now get solid     p youtube video  on the    ghz band  the extender doubled my speeds to around       down and     up  on the  ghz band  i m getting quadruple the old speeds at about       down and       up i can t believe that such a small and inexpensive piece of kit could improve my speeds like that  but it did  highly recommend this      
582,5.0 ,                       works as advertised  helped boost a weak signal  set up easy in main house and unplugged and installed in upstairs of adjacent guest house  once programmed just unplug and move to area where better wifi signal is needed  was a little put off with pics posted online reviews where back of unit literally was burned and melted due to insufficient ability to handle current and heat  hope my house wont burn down      
583,5.0 ,                       the netgear wifi range extender ex     is working perfectly for us so far   we just got it   very easy to set up  we used the wps method   we have a netgear wifi switch with the wps pushbutton and it linked up to extender right away with no issues   after set up i unplugged the extender and moved it down stairs  plugged it into a an outlet and it found the main switch as soon as it rebooted and started   we have      signal for our laptops and tablets   it made a huge difference for us   it really was a good choice for our needs     
584,3.0 ,                       easy to install however didn t not boost my sinal whatsoever  maybe it s for different uses that i don t need  all i was trying to do is boost my wi fi signal for my daughters e learning it was super easy  thought it would  boost my highest gamer package signal because we stream a lot  did not make a bit of difference  hope others have better luck for the use they need it for     
585,5.0 ,                       i don t like buying practical things but my cell phone and netflix upstairs were pitiful  my device didn t pick up our wifi signal automatically so i hopped on the computer and also was unable to connect  so i was starting to both panic and become annoyed  i happened to notice my cell phone picked up the signal and it was super easy to connect from there so try that method first  it works        
586,5.0 ,                       noticed faster connections immediately   it automatically connected all my added smart devices i was having trouble with before adding the extender   great price thru amazon   definitely recommend this product  and amazon prime is just wonderful to work with   recently purchased     mpps extenders  different brand  that were easy to set up and worked  but weren t strong enough   set this one up and wow  perfect   noticed faster performance and great connections immediately   thanks netgear   originally purchased a    mmps extender  different brand  that was very easy set up  but realized i needed more mpps      
587,5.0 ,                       we set up an exercise room in a small room in our basement  we added a tv  to watch while exercising but the wi fi signal in the room was really bad  so we were unable to stream video   i knew nothing about wi fi extenders but decided to give it a try  i plugged  the unit into an electrical outlet near my wi fi router   pushed the button on the extender and then pushed  the button on my router  the two connected with no problems  i then moved the wi fi extender to an electrical outlet in the basement and attached  the tv  streaming device  it works perfectly      
588,5.0 ,                       our router is in the basement  where the cable comes into the house  so we had some areas of weak reception  this boosted our coverage area to the entire house and additional areas outside  our smartphones will go between the primary wi fi router and this booster without issue  i have not tried it with my older laptop  it should pick up the booster  but if it s also picking up the primary router  i wonder if it will default to that  even if the signal strength is weaker      
589,4.0 ,                       not as easy as the instructions made out  took this older guy a little while to get the darned thing to work  and since i was also trying to get alexa connected to it rather than the main router  well    but once we got through the first part about seven times  a call to tech support  twice  we finally got it all working the right way  now the signal reaches upstairs fairly good      
590,1.0 ,                       maybe it s my router  but after a long process to get it hooked up i realized that it creates a clone of your network with an extension that you must switch to  well  after switching to this network  my computer speed dropped dramatically  plus  when i was connected and the device was within    feet of the device who s signal i wished to improve  the wifi signal was not any better  it may work for others  but not me      
591,4.0 ,                       it is a great wifi extender for the price  but the set up was really hard  i don t know if it s because we have a complicated system in our home but we could not set it up on our own  our audio visual guy had to do it for us  he was able to do it remotely so we didn t have to have him out to the house but it would not connect for us without his help      
592,5.0 ,                       i purchased two of these and i like having a strong connection around my home where ever i go   after purchasing and using i found out that no matter what  the download speed will be slower than with my router  but it doesn t matter   i use my phone or tablet when i am in different parts of the house where my router is and i am not usually uploading or downloading anything large  so i never notice a problem   very acceptable download speeds   also  our phones  laptops and tablet will usually switch automatically to the network extenders or to using the router depending on which one is closest   i have set them up using slightly different ssid s  homenet  homenet up  homenet down  so i know which one i am connected to  but you don t have to do that   it s been seamless and i never need to reboot them or anything   i also have a belkin in the bathroom  ya  know   for an emergency  and it works as well as the netgear extenders      
593,3.0 ,                       these extenders are very easy to install in just minutes  i have a netgear extender on the first floor of my house and it works great  my issue is i wanted another for the second floor  too  but when i set up the second extender  it just overlayed the first extender set up and i still only had one extender recognized by my router  no matter what i did  only one extender was available in the list of networks i gave this   stars because i m assuming the extender works  but it won t work as a second extender for the same router      
594,5.0 ,                       works like a charm router in front of wood frame home extender approx      in opposite end of home works just what i needed when gardening  i occasionally need info about particular plant culture now i can do such things everywhere in the garden checked with neighbor she can see extender signal on iphone approx        it was very weak but made it some day will take my ipad over to see if i can connect that much farther all in all  product is as described  easy to set up  works i m a happy customer   didn t use tech support would buy from seller again      
595,1.0 ,                       terrible signal quality  even with devices       feet away  it drops the signal several times a day  i honestly think my home network is worse by installing this product  instead of dealing with a weak signal in areas of the house  i now devices on the extender that try switching to the original network  somehow they are getting a better signal from the main router compared to the  extender  that is much closer  i tried   locations around the house  but this extender failed in every spot i will be returning this product  don t waste your money on it      
596,5.0 ,                       i need to replace our very weak extender   i was not looking forward to a complicated but necessary process   setting up this one was super easy   press the wps button on my router while the extender was plugged in next to it   wait a sec   unplug it and take it into the living room  plug it back in   bingo   great coverage through the thick walls and chimneys in my      house  and my living room is now fully connected   tech support not rated because i didn t need it      
597,2.0 ,                       don t bother with this  its cheap  but not with the hassle and its not dual band as advertised  its one or the other band  you can have it set for either     or    but not both  apparently this model had an issue with a firmware update that knocked out the dual band feature  its a headache to install and it takes way longer than you d expect and even then it only works mediocre on one or the other channels  by comparison  i ve got a legitimate big night hawk that was plug and play  it was      more than this  but definitely worth it  don t waste your money on this little cheap piece of junk      
598,4.0 ,                       instructions describe two ways to connect extender to router   followed instructions and extender connected to router within   to   minutes  signal strength was fine and did initial setup with extender next to router  however  devices subsequently connected to the extender showed  no internet  on the signal   after redoing the setup a couple of times and doing a factory reset  with the same results  found reviews describing the same problem on the internet   finally got it to work after updating the firmware software on the at t uverse router  resetting it  and updating the firmware on the extender   didn t  plug and play   which was frustrating and almost returned it  but in the end it finally worked  and it does what it s supposed to do  i can now connect to the internet where the signal from the at t router couldn t reach before      
599,4.0 ,                       product received timely and packaging was intact  as a female  this was painless and easy to install  i had difficulty receiving wifi to my tv at the back of my home  my tv would buffer a lot  since using this product i can admit my tv doesn t buffer as much and my phone isn t going back and forth on the internet and my phone provider  i can t say this is the reason i have had a tad bit better internet connection  as my buffering didn t always give me a issue  so my review can not be swayed one way or the other  i d like to think this is the reason i have had less of an issue since plugging in  what i can say is the product is easy to use  instructions were not hard to understand  and i have had some improved internet connection  if this helped at all  please click the  this helped thumb   thanks     
600,3.0 ,                       purchased as a warehouse deal in july      to bring wifi signal upstairs it quit working about a week or so ago  it extended the     range well enough to reach all areas of the house and some out side  it would cut out some times and got pretty hot had to put it in an area with good airflow to keep it from over heating  the     range was extended a small amount did not reach outside or the far side of the house up stairs  i am upgrading to the ac     extender      
601,1.0 ,                       i purchase this to replace an older netgear wifi extender   this thing is simply quirky   setup for me was a major pain  because it will not connect via wps  nor could i log into the device via the url given in the instructions   the only way to get it setup was to connect my iphone to it  and use the iphone as the setup device   my first action after setup was to change to a static ip  so i could log in via the net      at least that works   here s the kicker      after setup  if a device is not connect to this extender at all times  it reverts to factory defaults  and forces you to go through the setup before a device can be connected   yes  you read that right   at first i thought it was a glitch  but every time there has not been a device connected to the extender     as soon as i attempt to connect a device  it goes back to factory default settings  and requires me to run setup    every time   you don t dare call netgear support     they will withhold the information you need until you agree to pay a fee for it   i ve been down that road several time in the past  and they give you just enough free information  to make you think you re being helped     then hit you with the demand of a fee  they ve quoted me as much as      for a single support call  then wanted me to grant them access to my computer  before they actually help you fix a situation   finally  when it is in use  this thing gets hot   hot enough to smell  and i would suspect hot enough to possibly cause a fire were it placed behind a curtain  drape  or other fabric   this thing is getting returned  and i ll search elsewhere for a wifi extender      
602,5.0 ,                       bought this in october      and it has been well worth it   i am writing a review now because i am purchasing a second one and leaving this one behind for my roommate to use our internet service provider wanted to charge an additional monthly fee for a  faster speed    what a scam   this is a one time purchase  literally plug it in and follow the directions   my wifi computer would not connect without this and now i have super fast speed      
603,2.0 ,                       i have netgear gig everything in my house  after installing this i get great distance to my backyard from my house but man the signal is extremely unstable  sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn t  sometimes this extender takes my whole network down when it s powered on  if on the    ghz network it will take everything down requiring a reboot of my modem and router    issues without it plugged in  i would say if you need an extender where there are no devices between your router and this extender it should be ok  definitely not for use in a single family home  apartments maybe it would be ok      
604,1.0 ,                       if your wifi router security is wpa wpa  personal protected dont buy it is not compatible with certain routers  i could physically see that it would work great if i had the right system    we have really old equipment  company should have upgraded our equipment   or   years ago but they want us to pay extra   yeah no thanks     
605,1.0 ,                       i wasted   hours of my own time trying to troubleshoot the ac    model ex     wifi extender after signing in and it stating that there was an update to the model   shame on you for not removing it on these models after all the problems people experience with after downloading the update as it corrupts the unit to make in non functional  and in the end you will have to replace and buy a new one   i then sat on the phone for an hour and    mins listening to your music to be repetitively told i am  nd in line for tech support   yeah right  they must have been having a party or sleeping tonight as being second in line and having to hang up after an hour and    mins without getting the problem resolves pisses me off   x more   i am going to write nothing but bad reviews and deter people from your products with posting this on amazon and ever other tech site so people do not buy your products      
606,5.0 ,                       great wifi device   this can be used as a wireless range extender or a wireless access point   my house is also wired with cat   cable modem router wireless is plugged into a jack in end of the house away from my modem router wireless and i use it as an access point plugged into a jack on that end of the house  meaning   it s all  hard wired  together   if i m on the end of the house where the modem router wireless is  i access that wireless point   if i m on the opposite end of the house  i access the netgear device wireless access point   works great       
607,5.0 ,                       i really worry about how inept someone must be to not be able to install this or believe the instructions are insufficient  i m astonished these people were able to figure out how to open the packaging it shipped in this thing took about     minutes from opening the box to using my laptop with the internet it provided  if you ve evolved enough to use fire and basic tools you ll be able to figure this out the thing works great and extends my internet connection to my office perfectly  i highly recommend it      
608,5.0 ,                       i wanted to access my wifi at various places in my backyard  my main wifi router is inside a closet in the middle of the house  so the signal wasn t always strong enough to penetrate between   and   walls  hence  i bought this unit since it was reasonably priced  setup was fairly easy but i was initially concerned  the unit takes a bit of time to fully power up  maybe a full minute or more  and you can t proceed until it does  when first plugged in  the power light is orange  you must wait until it turns green before continuing  give it time   then  press the wps button on the unit and then the wps button on the wifi router  another minute and the connection is established  it doesn t happen instantly  that initial connection provides a   ghz connection  to also get a   ghz connection  press the wps button again on the unit and then the wps button again on the router  give it some time  a minute or so  and you re done  the router light on the unit should be displaying in green   then unplug the unit and move it to wherever you want  i used a wifi analyzer on my phone to make sure i had a router signal in my garage  and then plugged it into a socket  press the power button to power up  give it a minute  and the lights should be green and you re ready to go  two signals from the extender will show up  yourwifi  gext and yourwifi  gext   i find that the  ghz signal is by far the strongest everywhere for me  so that s what i use  connect your device using your  router password and you re connected  all around my back yard and throughout my house the  g signal is strong  the  g signal is strong in some areas but not others   so  a simple solution to my wifi issues  i just installed it  so i don t know how durable it is  if it fails  i ll update the review  but  so far  i recommend it      
609,5.0 ,                       this device is worthy of   stars      i called cox communications about their panoramic wi fi and they wanted     one time setup fee and        per month   that seemed a little excessive to me for a     device   i ordered it yesterday and it was delivered today   i purchased this device  because my research showed this was the best device compared to my modem  i have a netgear modem with the same specs as this device  it is recommended that the extender be the same similar to your main router modem   i have a two story condo and my main modem router combo is located upstairs in a closet   i wanted to get a better connection downstairs for my wi fi devices   tv  dish hopper  roku  android box  android phone and tablet  the package arrived next day as scheduled   i unpacked it and had a little issue connecting  but one small instruction were left out by the manufacturer   once i figured that out  it took me minutes to setup and connect   once connected i performed a speed test and i was getting a really good signal downstairs   the device is sturdy and works great  just as advertised   i noticed others had issues with setup  but it is really easy to setup   i m a technology person and i can easily figure things out on my own   i feel some others gave this product a   star because of their lack of technology intelligence  lol  i highly recommend this product if you have low internet signal in your home   this will fix the problem      
610,4.0 ,                       this extender was the easiest to setup that i have ever experienced  i like the lighted indicators on the device that gives an instant view of the connectivity status  the range of the extender seems adequate for my purposes  the only issue that  i have is that routinely my google home and alexa devices that are connected to the range extender say they can t connect to the internet  sometime it clears up with no intervention and sometime i have to reboot the router  the indicators on the extender indicate full connectivity when this happens  other devices  not connected to the netgear extender continue to work fine  i don t know if this is a router or a netgear problem  i will give the extender the benefit of the doubt and say it is a great device  if i could eliminate the extender as the problem i would give it five stars      
611,5.0 ,                       used this to extend my wifi for outdoor ring cameras   first i plugged the device in near router  once the green light was on i pressed wps button on device then pressed the wps button on xfinity s router   after a few minutes the synch was complete   unplugged device and then plugged it inside my garage   had to change the wifi network name on ring camera   this entire process took about    minutes   very pleased with the simple product setup and enhanced wifi range      
612,5.0 ,                       compared to my main router which is an old netgear n     this range extender provides a much more powerful signal  even when both are in the same room the difference is very noticeable you mileage will vary  but to maintain a full strength signal i could only put the extender maybe    feet away from the base station  because walls and ceilings were significantly affecting signal strength this is not a mesh router  i thought i could have the range extender show up as the same network as my existing router  but instead it has to show up with a different name  so even if you use the same password with both networks  you still have to add the new wifi provider to all your devices that might use it  in a house with several devices and several range extenders that would make the setup a hassle the dual band ability is nice for where we live because the    ghz band is very crowded but the  ghz band is almost empty in conclusion it fixed our wifi issues and i m very happy  because getting good coverage is always a pain  there are significantly cheaper wifi extenders out there and maybe those might have worked just as well  but this came from a quality brand  as far as i know   and there are certainly far  far more expensive options as well      
613,3.0 ,                       i wanted a simple wifi to wired ethernet bridge  this device does do that  and more   the setup of the device is unnecessarily complicated  during the setup you have to have the wifi repeater mode enabled  then you have to go back and disable it if you dont need it  i dont   netgear miss the mark with the    base tx port        ac easily exceeds that along with most cable internet connections today   for that   stars  i only got a netgear device because my netgear r     wifi access point is finicky about older wireless devices where it wont negotiate a reliable connection  older android phones  gen   apple tv to name two examples      
614,3.0 ,                       i see no difference in my signal strength or computer performance with this product  however  it may be just the tool i needed to prove that i have crappy internet service  i can t say the provider name but i can tell you it starts with an  a  and ends with a  t    hopefully  you will have better success than me      
615,4.0 ,                       i first installed this on a dsl system and i had problems getting very far from the modem router   only could go    feet further out in order for it to work   i just upgraded to cable     mbps with an arris modem and a tplink      router   now i can move it out to where i wanted it   when i switch to the network of the extender sometimes it takes a while to connect and says no internet but finally connects   speed directly from my modem on the  g network gets me up to anywhere from    to     mbps and about    with the  g network   the wifi extender gets around    on the  g and around    on the  g   my cheaper ex     gets me about    on the  g and maybe    on the  g   it is real touchy when connecting and if you connect the  g first it takes less time to reconnect to the  g   i have no idea why  it just says no internet connection for quite a while if you start with the  g   i think the extender is worth it and has great speed compared to all the cheap stuff out there   i has two ex     s but could not get one of them to connect   i decided i did not need it anyway as the main router has a very good signal and i almost don t need an extender   i also have a cheap wifi repeater in my basement that i was able to install but it also cuts the speeds down to comparable to the ex          
616,3.0 ,                       i have     meg internet speed when i m hardlined in on my desk top  my wireless is far from that    it s fast  but no where near that speed  which is understandable   i got the booster to help increase the speed for my xbox that is about    feet and several room walls away  i found that the regular wifi signal that i get from my router was more stable than the one i got from the netgear extender  when running speed tests on the xbox  the netgear would fluctuate the download speed from anywhere between    megs to    megs  whereas my regular wireless router was consistently hitting around    megs  give or take    megs  to me  the extended then becomes useless  because not only does it not actually help get the speed closer to what i pay  but it isn t stable enough to use for most gaming it was fairly easy to install though  and generally i have had good experiences with netgear    just not this device      
617,4.0 ,                       and this time their tech support told me it was after trouble shooting it with me   for a few weeks it worked well   then it started refusing to connect and if i got it connected it was as likely to fail in the next    minutes as the next    hours   but what i learned by doing analytics with it was that it wasn t sending out a strong enough signal   about    dbm which is right at the margin to stream to a  k tv so i ordered one from td link at twice the price and  it s signal strength was in the     dbm to     dbm range a huge improvement   but it didn t work either   it s on its way back and being replaced by the same unit which will hopefully work      
618,3.0 ,                       i really can t complain too much about this product  at first it was great  then about two months ago it would just stop broadcasting  the only fix was to disconnect from the wall  wait    seconds and connect to the outlet  once reconnected  it would broadcast but then i would be forced to restart tv  tablet  phone or whatever is connecting to the extender to get a complete connection  it appears that over the past week it has been happening more often  over the years i have owned quite a few netgear items  i suppose it s time to try a different brand and see what happens      
619,2.0 ,                       i have a netgear nighthawk r     and i needed to extend the  ghz range       feet  the netgear ex     was able to do this but only for a short amount of time  once the ex     loses wireless connectivity it does not try to reestablish this connection  instead you have to log in to the ex     and run the configuration tool again  when you run the config tool again the current firmware won t let you join your wireless network back to the same ssid  the only way around this is to reset the ex     to factory defaults and start over  this is not acceptable after resetting the ex       times instead of using it as a wireless extender i turned it into a wired access point  so far this seems to work  the signal is not very strong but for     i ll take it      
620,2.0 ,                       would not set up with and of the information provided with the unit or any of the online help   had to  call customer support   not in this country     i had to let him have access to my computer and router after he could not get it connected either   he tried several more things and then told me the extender will not work with my router   i explained that this was really poor concidering my router was also netgear   he said yes it should work   he said  i could pay to have a special technician come to my home to try to fix it   i told him that was not going to happen   he then said let me try one more thing   he then was able to get it to connected   the entire process including my time into it  took just over   hours   if i ever wanted to set it up on a new service  it would be the same thing all over  once connected it is working ok  i would hink twice before pu rchasing this particular item      
621,1.0 ,                       the size of the unit is small so you don t have this huge thing hanging on wall outlet  it is easy enough to get set up  that is about it  i have tried various outlets  it has only two walls to go thru yet very little to no difference on signal strength  the wifi speed test is slightly better than without this range extender  i purchased this item to improve the performance of a ring doorbell  i have even plugged it in to a extension cord and hung behind the wall the doorbell is on and even next to the doorbell with no improvement  for what it is worth the wire less router the extender is coupled with is a netgear r     which does as well or better by itself  the relatively low cost and positive reviews got me to try it and perhaps you will as well  hope your outcome is better      
622,1.0 ,                       garbage  do not buy worked for   days  now it won t connect to the router on     ghz or   ghz from    feet away from the wi fi router    floor down required opera web browser on win   laptop to login to the extender  other browsers or devices wouldn t work to login spent    min today trying to get the extender to work in the same room as the wi fi router  nope back in the box it goes  back to amazon i should have listened to all the negative reviews pitiful garbage coming out of netgear      
623,1.0 ,                       the unit worked fine at first and then about a month ago    months after purchase  the throughput went down to barely usable  per their help pages  i factory reset the unit and now a reboot it refuses all connections and it can t be setup  unfortunately  customer support ends after   months unless you pay for it  since the power led turns green  it isn t a hardware issue  and not covered by the   yr warranty  i guess they don t stand behind their firmwear  if i want support  i have to pay for it  service costs about as much as the unit  buyer beware  i ll never by netgear again      
624,4.0 ,                       what i didn t know  you must choose your either the router or extender this device isn t what i thought it was  which was to seamlessly extend my home wifi from one area to another i e  walking from the strong signal from the house to out into the garage  to back into the house the extender takes your wifi and adds an extension  re names a second network   so you must choose which network you want to be connected  an example would be  if you were in a parking lot  saw a list of available networks which you could get free wifi  say  starbucks or barnes   noble  you have to choose which one you want to connect  so this isn t that good for moving around the house with with your phone  laptop  or tablet      
625,5.0 ,                       i was so skeptical with this purchase  however i eventually figured it out  it totally worked and i m pleasantly pleased with this purchase  hey i m no tech genius either so i m not afraid to admit amazed too  it s definitely worth the extended wifi range  i have a brick house and i use it on the other side of my     car garage  two thumbs up      
626,1.0 ,                       i selected this order to go with a netgear nighthawk router figuring that items from the same company would be compatible and effortless set up   not so   there is no wps button on my nighthawk r    p router so i was required to try a web setup   after several hours of    easy setup  instructions  i gave up  unsuccessful and decided to return the extender product wouldn t you think the company could provide compatible products      
627,1.0 ,                       it worked on and off for the first couple weeks  i thought it was finely working well but i was wrong  it helped some with extending wifi but it s not that great  still have a lot of buffering issues when more than   person is using the extended  i decided to keep the device and we got a new router a couple months after i got the extended and it would not connect  called customer support and that was useless they were gonna charge me     for a   month warranty since the warranty ran out on my device   that more than i paid for it  wtf  i did a factory reset and it took several attempts to get it to link to the new router  now i m having to unplug and plug it back in daily to get it to work  and the signal is worst than before  i wish i had returned it when first purchased  guess i ll look for one from a different brand      
628,1.0 ,                       i ve been working in and around the it industry for over     years  and i have to say  don t buy this  the guides  login pages  default password doesn t work   and yes  i know how to reset it    and  support are a joke  if you plan on using wps   go right ahead  i will not  the unit i got was a radio transmitter  that is all      
629,1.0 ,                       spent three hours trying to connect to this extender  i have a   year old r     netgear nighthawk router w latest firmware    tried following printed instructions  repeatedly fail   tried using online instructions  repeatedly fail   tried using nighthawk app  repeatedly fail   throw extender into forest from back patio   angry at wasted time and lost money   felt good though     
630,5.0 ,                       there s a reason this wifi range extender gets great reviews   it works very well and the low cost is unbeatable   i easily connected via wps to my asus ac      router per the instructions and was up and running in a few minutes   i live in a building with aluminum wall studs and have had issues with getting signal from one end of the house where the router is located to the opposite end of the house that is until now   i was able to literally plug in the range extender in to an outlet as far away as i physically could and get excellent signal   this is the way to go and i m glad i read the reviews and made this purchase first      
631,2.0 ,                       we watch netflix  amazon prime video and youtube a lot in our smart tv once in a while  my wife will complain of poor internet connection  i figured i ll add a wifi range extender this one looks good and has a small size surprisingly  connecting this to my existing wifi network was botheasy and next to impossible  at first  i tried connecting via a web browser set up  i couldn t get past the first click it just won t let me continue  so  i went with the second method via wps  after several tries  it worked i immediately connected the smart tv and the signal was great  no problems  after several hours  it keeps dropping the connection  sometimes it works  sometimes it doesn t  a few days of this going back and forth gives me aheadache  i ll give it another week and if it doesn t stabilize  i ll return it      
632,5.0 ,                       installs and configures very easily  we installed it in our detached garage about     from the main wifi router in the house  and it extends usable range not just to the garage but well into the back yard and garden  both my android and my mate s iphone switch quickly and seamlessly between the house and the ac    and back again  we dropped our landline and i can use my android phone in voip mode over the ac    with excellent voice quality  fyi  our main wifi router is not a netgear device but the netgear ac    wifi range extender works flawlessly with it anyway      
633,1.0 ,                       the signal drops and i lose access to the extended network  pretty unstable  netgear support told me that it was because the extender was in a dead spot  never mind the fact that the signal light was red sometimes and green other times  if it is a dead spot  why is the signal strong at other times     and that the extender was only     from the router  and     from the desired place where the signal had been weak  i have reset the device multiple times and it still doesn t work reliably      
634,5.0 ,                       i bought this to use as a wifi to ethernet bridge   unfortunately  it cannot operate in that mode  to the best of my knowledge  without relaying the network   i d rather it didn t do that  but in any event  it works well   i use this as the wifi adapter for my logitech squeezebox  which has mediocre wifi   now the reception and performance are excellent with no drops nor rebuffering when playing flac files   nice compact design and good built in web interface for setup      
635,4.0 ,                       great product  read the review from the network engineer so that was helpful in evaluating it  keep in mind that if you want to use it as a wifi bridge it will broadcast a     and   ghz signal if you so configure it  setup was easy  no crazy settings to change on your computer while setting up  recommend setting it up from final destination with a laptop of smartphone  that way you don t have to play with placement   speeds once properly set up and calibrated to wifi router were very good  only added a     ms penalty on most latency measures   not a scientific study just anecdotal experience   great for extending your network to your expensive tv that has a mediocre       x module or computer  etc  if your a gamer worrying about latency in your twitchy games then make sure you get a physical connection not a wireless range extender  this would be great for most other use cases   i can play fps just fine with this unit so your mileage may vary antenna from unit is good but not the best   this is just the limitation of radio signals and this small  efficient unit   honestly the best way to use this device is to run a      ft ethernet cable from your router to this unit   that way you get the best of both worlds and pay wireless overhead twice somewhat concerned with longevity  since this unit gets a little warm and there is no active ventilation   passive cooling should do the job but for this price point its forgivable overall a great buy      
636,1.0 ,                       i got the netgear on sunday but didn t open it until monday  it was easy to connected to my modem but i had the watch a video on youtube to figure out how to connect it because the instructions make it impossible do you understand  okay from there it only works   hour and kick me out and don t let me  connect back to it and i turn it off and it still didn t let me  this netgear has so many good reviews  that was the only reason i bought it  i have two pictures showing where it s not repeating itself modem extend and it shows that the light is red and it s supposed to be green and the other on is a screenshot of my phone and it s trying to connect in it doesn t let me      
637,1.0 ,                       easy to set up  that s the good news seldom worked  that s the bad news  after following instructions and placing it properly i did not always get a steady  strong signal  the  k would often disconnect  the  k seldom worked as a backup  i tried all the suggested solutions  including a youtube video to no avail  it now disconnected and sits in a box i do not recommend this product      
638,5.0 ,                       purchased this to extend range   the setup i had was a  th generation apple extreme which i extended with a   nd generation apple express   i have     mbs service   i now have the apple extreme and the netgear unit   i currently have all ac standard devices for personal use   the netgear extender boosted the signal from   mbs to    mbs in the device furthest from the base station   you have an option to enable the netgear to extend either or both     or  g networks   did both now better signal on roku device   i set up the device using an ipad   follow the simple instructions and this is as easy as replacing a light bulb   just make sure you reconnect any device to the new network and don t forget your passwords      
639,5.0 ,                       product  netgear ac    wifi range extender  ex        nas bought it to get my vonage adapter and cordless telephone base away from under the cable modem under the tv  and to move it to my office upstairs setup involved plugging the device in  and clicking the wps buttons on the device and on the comcast modem  the extender connected almost immediately  and set up its own access point name using the comcast connection password  up and running in less than a minute  connected the vonage adapter to the extender s ethernet port  service established immediately  bam  done in less than   minutes total      pia factor      
640,5.0 ,                       install was truly a breeze thanks to a few top reviewers  i can t believe i ve had this in my  save for later  for a year and missed out on an awesome connection  the wi fi on my phone would always take at least   attempts to connect to the modern even if i were    feet away and then drop on a regular basis  now it connect instantly and keeps the connection even on the opposite side of the house  my husband says his computer connects beautifully  when it was spotty before   i kick myself for waiting  don t do the same      
641,1.0 ,                       i bought this product and in a couple of months it broke  so they sent me a new one and in less than   months  it s not working  i just spent    minutes arguing with their technical support because they want me to pay  for technical support to fix the software for a year for      which is more than a brand new product  or        for a one time fix and free support for   months  that s nearly the cost of a new product  customer support is telling me their product usually works for   or   years  so how do i get two that last for less than   months  no thank you      
642,2.0 ,                       i purchased this because my apartment has apartment wide wifi  which is great in the office but terrible in our apartment  set up was easy  we set up both the  ghz and    ghz bands so that i could have my private network and a guest network  but    didn t work  so then i tried just the  ghz network  nothing  i tried the    ghz network  still nothing  i kept resetting the thing  trying different network encryptions  etc  for   hours  and nothing could get it working  finally i got a connection for a few minutes and noticed a setting on the setup page  by the way  who s the genius that decided you need to have an internet connection to manage the extender  why can t i access it by the ip address when it s offline   called fastlane  which lets you set up a dedicated band to connect your device and the extender  and a band to connect the extender to the router  i figured the router probably only had a    ghz band  don t know why it didn t work before     so i set it up to connect to the router on the    ghz band and extend it on the  ghz band  presto  it worked  for a day  when it worked  i got way better speeds on my laptop and desktop through the ethernet port  but it just didn t work consistently  after the first day it kept dropping every couple minutes  i d have to reset the power just to get it working again  eventually i got tired of it and threw it back in the box  where it s stayed until it goes back to amazon today  reading the reviews  this issue seems like an outlier  so maybe i got a bad unit  but i ve heard horror stories about netgear s tech support  so i think i m just gonna get my money back and try my luck elsewhere      
643,5.0 ,                       i bought this because i have a really long house and my modem and router are sitting on one side of the house instead of the middle of it  in result  one side of the house doesn t get as strong of a signal  ironically  the side of the house that doesn t get that strong of a signal is the side that we really need the signal on  we stream movies and live streams to our tv on that side of the house and it gets really jumpy  if that makes sense   but this helps solve that problem by producing a stronger signal that we were receiving at that end of the house  i put in towards the middle of my house  the movies and live streams can go without jumps and lags every   seconds and i love it  this is a great product and would recommend  it to someone who has the same issues that i had      
644,4.0 ,                       received this wifi repeater booster today   i bought it from amazon warehouse   it is great condition   set up was so easy   i used the wps method and it took me maybe      minutes   i set up both the     and   ghz channels   to connect the   ghz channel just repeat the process of pushing the wps button on the repeater and then the router   then just wait a minute or two for it to connect to the router   i plugged it in on the second floor pretty far from my router and it is performing really well   i have a     and   connection which i can select   in one area  where i was getting next to no signal  i am getting good signal   the speed is also faster slightly on the repeater channels i have to say i am very satisfied so far   i have another generic repeater i got on ebay    i am sure you have seen them   well  that one did not work well at all which is why i bought this one   i looked at the     version but figured for a few extra bucks the dual channel and potentially faster speed was better one more thing    i connected my fire stick to the repeater channel   ghz and my fire stick is responding faster now   this is an extra bonus   in fact  the signal from the repeater is strong on the first level as well this repeater was easy to setup and solved my problem   i recommend it update june         today my amazon fire stick had trouble connecting to the internet  it eventually worked after turning the stick on and off  later on i went to look at the device and led showing router connection was off  i had to unplug and replug this in  not sure if i will return it  maybe i will have to plug it in when i need it  when it works it works well june     i could see the two wifi signals but neither one would let me connect   i had to unplug and replug it in and then the connections worked   seems a little spotty though   i dropped this one star because of the inconsistency july        overall happy with this  seems to be more consistently accessible  much better signal than the main signal from my router      
645,5.0 ,                       easy to setup  ensure that you setup the extender near your router prior to relocating it  i live in germany and the houses  are mainly cement and block  so coverage isn t very good on the second and third floors  i have the extender setup in the hallway on the second floor and i have never had full signal strength on all floors in my house prior to this extender  i used my iphone for the setup and didn t have any issues  it takes a few minutes for the extender to connect to the router  it s basically like having another router for my top two floors fyi  i did have to set up an account with netgear but i knew that prior to buying the product      
646,3.0 ,                       i was unable to get the router and extender to connect find one another using the wps buttons i had to try following the instructions to connect using the web   these instructions were nearly useless   it gives an url to open   when you get there it tells you the specific models that the instructions apply to   this model is not one of those listed   then it mentions another list of urls you can try depending on the device you are using to access the web   these options didn t help much either after about     hours  i was connecting my phone to wifi  i noticed an available network called netgear ext   i connected to this and was finally able to access the extender setup page   i completed the setup and got it working the above sets are no where to be found in the instructions included in the box      
647,3.0 ,                       it s an ok solution for     to extend your wi fi coverage in your home or office  but don t expect the signal to travel too far even when set to      via the browser s control panel i plugged this extender in when i got it  after using it for about a month i d say it works ok  to fill in a fead zone if you need a cheap solution  but as always you get what you pay for  the  g coverage isn t that great with this extender  the speed drops off considerably when i leave the room it s in  the  g coverage works a little better but my router s coverage blows this extender s out of the water in both  g and  g  it does eliminate a dead zone at the back of the house however  but internet speed isn t too great when using the extender unless you re pretty close to it  it seems to receive signal okay  just has a problem with low transmit power      
648,2.0 ,                       sometime the devices catch the signal  sometimes not  sometimes connects  then just stops connecting  inconsistent at best  tech only supports for   months       then they try to sell you a multi year  support package  for several hundreds of dollars  and if you don t take that  then they offer you a one year package for a little less  and if you don t take that they offer you a   month package for a little less   you see where this goes  right  kinda the deffiniton of ransom product   sell you a marginally functional product hoping to up sell you the service package when  not if  it fails     stay away from netgear         
649,4.0 ,                       first  no worries on jumping back in bed with at t and buying their so called extender  haha at t  you are not getting my         lol so i was hoping for plug in the netgear extender  connect  check coverage and go  but that inevitable   thing goes wrong   i started the instructions over and over again by pushing the wps button on my att bgw    router and the wps on ng  and again and again  still now light for wps  so i unplugged everything and tried again and again decided to check my wifi and i m getting a few new networks  the name of my wifi plus  ext or  ext   so hmmm  but i have no password    back to to the drawing board  i mean the instructions booklet because the video on amazon did not cover this  voila  use your own password in the   or  ext   it worked however however however  the wps light is still not green but blank  i don t think it ever will light up  it is up and working and tested in my back master bedroom and the upstairs office and it is working  but give it a few seconds before you bitch like i did because it does go from old   bars to   bars and has a good speed  yeah    hope this helps everyone      
650,1.0 ,                       i don t understand    it s so easy to set up yet so difficult  worked the first time i installed it and then it suddenly stopped doing its job  to give extended wifi signal  internet may not be available  so sick and tired of seeing this error   i tried everything to fix this issue  reset to factory settings  moving the extender closer  waiting for the signal to appear  troubleshooting online using the one and only device that could get the signal but nothing seemed to work  i made some research hoping that i could get an answer to my issue and during my research  the only thing i found is that netgear phone support is absolute trash and i m not willing to waste long minutes upon hours to not get anything fixed  i guess the best thing to do is to talk to your isp about your options to exntend your wifi range and hope they don t tell you to pay extra per month for extended wifi feature    i am very conflicted whether to purchase a more expensive modern extender or keep looking for the perfect budget extender  hoping that the one i received was defective or just isn t compatible with my current modem and router setup         returning      
651,5.0 ,                       i purchased this product a few days ago  was having trouble getting it to connect to my router  my cell phone rings and it s netgear asking me if i need help setting up my new router extender  i said yes while they tell me to fire up my desktop or laptop  then they start telling me i have been hacked because i don t have a firewall  i can purchase one for           or       in the mean time my wife and daughter call netgear and ask them about them calling my phone and asking about a firewall  this is a scam  netgear does not call you and they never ask for a payment  beware of these people who try to get your credit information  the real netgear people walked me through the setup and my extender works great  i get wifi all the way to my farthest point in my back yard where i never did before      
652,5.0 ,                       i had some issues trying to install this initially  because the wps option was not working  if you don t have wps available for your router then it might become a pain in your      to install this as it is not user friendly at all fortunately i ended up finding out that the wps option of my router was turned off by default  so changing this setting got my extender working right away  and i am pretty happy with the results   now my dad has good signal quality at his room and he spends a lot of time watching netflix        
653,1.0 ,                       this thing is piece of crap i ve tried   of them now  both present issues below major issues    it cannot effectively extend a  g signal to an adjacent room at all  with the connecting device rating the signal it transmits as poor or just not picking it up  i m trying to get a smart tv to connect to it while it  extends  a signal from a cable modem router  so i am forced to connect to it via  g only practically  but even then   it cannot reconnect on its own to the wireless router it s supposed to be extending if the wireless router restarts or drops its connection and  reboots  its connection  so i m forced to manually restart this extender everytime  usually by unplugging it and plugging it back into the ac outlet  my cablemodem restarts which is often what s needed is a set it and forget kind of solution which i assume the       extenders provide  meaning they reconnect on their own to source or reestablish internet connection to source on own   this does not do that  and again it s just useless for trying to extend  g signal as  g into an adjacent room i recommend trying some other extender product      
654,3.0 ,                       not sure why all the great reviews but i followed directions and it took a few times to get it connected  once connected  it will lose connection if i move it anymore than    feet  so basically i guess i will use it for just that room  and also  i dont like that it creates a new wifi signal instead of just boosting original  so you have to sign in to a whole different wifi whenever you want to use  im not the most knowledgeable on wifi so maybe its just me      
655,5.0 ,                       using as a wireless bridge to ethernet for a tivo mini where no other connections were available   tried other solutions and even this unit in    ghz mode and it comes up a bit short with frequent lags in the video   configured to  ghz mode and has been working perfectly with zero problems for over a month   hd video is perfect  guides are quick  everything works just like a hardwire ethernet connection its a keeper      
656,3.0 ,                       this didn t work the way i thought it would at all  i had a really hard time just getting on their   net  site to get the product up and running  i m fairly tech savvy and had to call three times and spend a few hours on the phone   mostly resetting the device   as if the    th time would lead to a different result  i finally got it going myself by restarting my wifi router  which they told me would do nothing  but it s what finally worked  even up and running  the extended connections aren t solid      is better than   but they still go in and out a fair amount      
657,3.0 ,                       this product over all is excellent hardware   the product is well made has a small footprint   it would have been nice if the antennas were removable as so add larger ones  but at this price point it was not expected software   i am not a lover of wps setup so i used my laptop and the wifi setup instead   very easy and well thought out   probably the easiest interface i have ever used price   this is the cheapest   most affordable unit that supports both    g      g wifi at both ends and manages the data remarkable well final thoughts   unless you have a       square foot home buy it   i can not attest to the reliability over time of the product yet but so far this unit is a no brainer   please ovoid the cheaper sub     units you will not be happy after a few weeks       i hate to say it but i am sending it back   the unit is not stable at all   i end up having to reset it at least     times a week meaning i have to unplug and plug it back in   not good      
658,2.0 ,                       spent a couple of hours trying to install on my own   no joy   then i spent more than   hours with netgear tech support on chat and the phone   after   hours of trying to set up using the extender web interface   the tech suggested trying to use wps   it was then he suggested that i move the extender adjacent to the router     foot   and then i lost another connection with the techs   subsequently  i was finally able to connect the extender to my router  but now my iphone reports  weak security  on the connection   a cheapo chinesium extender worked better than this   no more netgear for me      
659,1.0 ,                       wifi signal   starred because it would have been great if it worked  not saying the device doesn t turn on  cause it does  but the extended ssids you get are wack and useless because they have no internet connection  no matter how many ways i have tried to get this going  i was really excited about this product  it just never worked  i ve also seen many similar issues to mine on netgears website community  no one really seems to have one fixed answer as a lot of these issues are unique for some unknown reason  good luck if you decide to buy  it has worked for some not saying its never worked before  at least thats what i gathered from a few youtube reviews i ve watched  but again i have personally tried following every review and manual and suggestion and way i could to get it to work  even agreed to boost only a single band instead of both like it says it can  still did not establish internet signal  also  make sure that before purchasing that your router is wpa security compatible  otherwise you have to try setting up non wps through wifi and it s ridiculous how many times it will tell you on the second  newly made  ssid s password is incorrect  even though its the exact same password as your original ssid  definitely can see why this product keeps going on sale  sucks   ethernet has best possible help to get connection established but defeats the purpose of wireless connections  plus my ethernet connection kept disconnecting even thought it was never touched  i ve logged into genie a thousand times plus  genie is the most unhelpful mess  unless you re tech comprehensive in the slightest you can possibly maneuver  but even so it doesn t hold much power in helping you figure out whats wrong  just shows the diagnostics  if you decide to buy anyway and figure it out  please comment exactly what you did to establish working connection to your devices through the extender  thank you   returning this item for not working  nothing against amazon   netgear   i gave it a try for   days  hopefully you last longer with this pos      
660,3.0 ,                       i originally purchased this for my new house as a way to get my xfintity connection to stay on for my office room  my modem is in the living room and i currently have    mbps with comcast but noticed issues keeping a steady connection in my office  i contacted comcast and they referred me to a network extender where after some research i thought the netgear ac    would get the job done originally the connection set up was very quick and easy so that was the only plus  when it came to running a speed test after being connected to it with a green signal  average download mbps i get is     which is an increase from the original      i was getting without the wifi extender  it works so so  but for the money i wish i would have known and saved myself the     and looked else where      
661,2.0 ,                       this is probably the worst wifi extender i ve ever used  from the flimsy setup instructions to the arduous process of connecting to the device while attempting to set it up would enrage the most patient person  once set up  the device regularly needs restarts as it tries to claim passwords are incorrect   the same passwords you ve saved to devices since the initial setup  restarting is the only thing that solves this problem  the worst part of the device  it has terrible range  it literally cannot extends    feet into the guest bedroom the price may seem enticing  but this device is hot trash in terms of what you get      
662,2.0 ,                       straight to the point i bought this one for the  ghz  the  ghz is nearly useless if you re more than    feet away from the extender      seems to work well and does have some range i ll mess with this more before i decide to send it back or not then update my review as for the people saying the set up using the included directions doesn t work either didn t follow them correctly or there was some other factor causing the issue  i plugged mine into the outlet next to the router  followed the web browser instructions and viola  internet      
663,1.0 ,                       while the setup was pretty straightforward  the reliability was for s  t  i got these because my existing extenders  cheap  no name brands  didn t support  ghz and since i was primarily using them for the outdoor cameras  i wanted the extra speed  i bought two of these and the results were identical  they set up fine  you get everything connected  works for up to an hour then everything goes offline  connecting to the network on them via my iphone ran me through the setup process  as iff they had never been configured  and despite users saying they work great if you set them up in the same room as the primary router then move them  the  ghz was frequently unable to connect    feet from the primary gateway  and showing      signal strength i m happy for everyone who gave these   stars and had no issues  but these are either going to work great for you like they did for them or you re wasting your money i m shopping again to see if linksys has an extender out there that works on all bands  all frequencies  for more than      minutes at a stretch without the need for a factory reset and reconfigure  i absolutely wouldn t recommend these for security cameras  since the point is reliable connectivity so they don t miss anything  i screwed around with these for   days before giving up on them      
664,2.0 ,                       i have a cisco linksys wireless router and purchased   of these extenders  after spending   hours of setting up  defaulting to factory settings  and researching potential solutions to connection stability issues  i gave up and instead connected them to my secondary wireless network  on isp set top box    here are the issues i have with these extenders     they get really hot once running     connection to my cisco router was hit or miss  devices would not connect  would drop connections  and or internet connection would not be available  even though connection was active through the main wireless network      genie app  wizard  was inconsistent in saving settings    after entering password multiple times on one of the extenders  it wouldn t save and i d need to reinput the passwords until it saved them  not sure if i ll be keeping these    my experience with consumer grade computer equipment is that when they run hot  as these do  they tend to fail sooner rather than later      
665,5.0 ,                       we had a weak wifi signal in one side of the house opposite where our router is installed   i followed the instructions for the pairing of my network and plugged it in   it worked as advertised and now we have a signal strength on the opposite side of the house comparable as if we were sitting next to our router      
666,1.0 ,                       i couldn t even complete the setup  it kept kicking me out so the  networks  existed but didn t actually have any signal  not only that  but it then messed with my computer s ability to connect to our actual wifi  i could connect to other networks  just not mine  all my other devices were still connected to our wifi  the extender literally cost me an entire day of work because it wouldn t allow my computer to connect  even after i unplugged it  i m returning this piece of garbage  i would give this negative stars if i could      
667,5.0 ,                       this works great  but if you want to extend the unit and not use it as a separate wifi access point  then read this first    after calling netgear  they walked me through the set up  since i had already set it up once  i had to reset it  here s how plug in near router  use a paper clip and push down in small hole on the same side as the buttons for    seconds wait for it to reset to green  go into your settings   wifi on your phone  go through the new user set up process that will come up on your phone automatically  select both the     and the   ghz for your router and then enter in your password for your router when prompted  when it gives you the screen with the editable name for your router  take off the   ext and     ext so the name is exactly the same as your normal wifi router  finish the set up  unplug and plug it in where you want it in the house  should work as expected  you can call netgear if you need more help  i hate their automated system  but if you can get to a person  they are helpful for sure   netgear                  from the us  indiana in my case  so far  after setting this up  it has worked great  good luck      
668,1.0 ,                       we had lots of connection issues on one side of our house  i researched wifi range extenders and the ex     was highly rated and met our needs   installation was easy and fast and the issues were gone  i can stream movies without interruptions and our phones and tablets don t drop out  very happy with it and recommend highly bought in january  suddenly just quit working   very frustrated with this product   i am a big fan of netgear and plan on contacting them about their extender  but i find i can t recommend this to anyone      
669,1.0 ,                       we have the worst wifi connection at work   i work in an old mid century modern building made out of concrete blocks and concrete   it s a great building  don t get me wrong  but the signal for wifi is absolute garbage   our wifi router and modem are in the basement of our office  surrounded by concrete   the signal for the wifi is strong if you re above the router on the ground level  but once you begin to move away  it deteriorates drastically i purchased this wifi extender to help with our signal   we use an apple airport extreme for our wifi needs   several people asked questions about whether it works with apple products   the answers were mixed   thus without a conclusive answer  i decided to purchase this product in the hopes that i would be able to get it to work unfortunately    it didn t work   i followed all of the directions in the booklet   had all the proper green lights on  blinking  and doing what they re suppose to be doing   yet  i still couldn t get a connection from the device   rinse and repeat   fail   hmmm    let me try again   fail i am disappointed with this product   this product might work for another router  but it does not work with apple products      
670,1.0 ,                       i purchased this a couple of months ago  it took awhile to set up but it was finally working and fairy well   fast forward to now     i got a new router from spectrum  the same router  model etc     and we named it the same as well   the extender would no longer get internet so i factory reset it         times  it still will not get internet  the set ups all said complete  it connects  but no internet  i hard wired it  and still no internet  all of my other computers and devices work so it is not the router  i scoured the internet for a solution  and it appears i am not alone  no resolutions found  i gave up   i just purchased a new  different brand and will start over again  based on the difficulty i had and the lack of support  i do not recommend this product      
671,1.0 ,                       it doesn t work as intended  left it near the router and it still didn t get more than  mbps download or upload speed  it even makes my home network traffic slower  i have gigabit service and my router broadcasts         under    ghz and when i use the extender and connect to it  i barely get  mbps will be returning it      
672,2.0 ,                       do you like to spend your free time troubleshooting a simple device that should work out of the box   do you enjoy spending your evenings searching for double secret factory resets and bickering with tech support personnel with barely intelligible accents   this device may be is for you from the beginning  my extender lost connection with my router despite a supposedly excellent signal   it would good days at a time behaving perfectly  only to drop out for several hours  return  drop out again   finally     days after the date of purchase  the complimentary support lasts    days  coincidentally       it lost connection and didn t come back   the solution   i dunno  three factory resets and reconfigurations later it came back   but don t worry  it ll mysteriously disappear again tomorrow   junky junk junk word to the wise   don t call the support after    days   they ll charge you for their own crummy interface sw and flakey factory resets   factory reset it  power cycle your router  do it all again and eventually it ll work   or  throw it out the window and buy something that works more reliably      
673,1.0 ,                       this is the biggest waste of money  after going through everything too set it up and it says it s connected as soon as you try to connect anything to it and use it  it just says no internet  i tried to login to see what s wrong and it won t recognize my account i set up  i reset it twice to try to fix it and after almost   hours i still can t get it to  connext  tech support just told me to do exactly what i was doing and it wasn t working  they would help anymore without me paying for an extended service plan because i have had it for over a year  we set it up once but it never worked and we assumed it was our previous internet provider  when we just switched i tried to set it up again as i ll be it s been completely horrible   i would return it if i could but it s now just a purchase i completely regret and have to move on      
674,1.0 ,                       i got the wifi extender a couple days ago  tonight  my husband  a computer technician  read the instructions and proceeded to plug it  as soon as he plugged it  there was an explosion  it burned and left half of my house without power  my husband could have been hurt or worse  i would have give it zero stars if i could      
675,1.0 ,                       this device is only    feet from the router  but the amber light for the router is on half the time   if i put it any closer to the router  there would be no purpose in buying it   the only thing you want to do on this device is web surfing   i have    mb wifi in the house and usually only get   mb to   mb   this thing  when connected to it  speeds are around    to   mb      
676,4.0 ,                       got it for my detached garage it was easy to set the first place i put it all the lights were green witch meant it was connected and there was a device connected but i still had poor wifi signal in my garage moved it to another outlet signal light went to red but i have a wifi signal in my garage now i have a smart thermostat and rocu tv in the garage and working good     
677,4.0 ,                       we have one of these that works great and has for years   so we ordered a second one   when it came  we could not get it to work at all   replaced  new product sent out thinking the one we received was faulty  next arrives  same problem   dig a little deeper and we find out that the mac address printed on the unit is not what our router sees as the mac address   adjust to router specified mac  works like a charm it s a great unit  once you get it set up      
678,1.0 ,                       after installing my new extender  the installation program asked if i d like to upgrade the firmware   sure  why not   well  after the  upgrade   the device is completely bricked   power light flashes green  blinking   help documentation doesn t even list that mode   a quick google search revealed that the device is  in fact  completely bricked  but i can revert the firmware if i download the file to a computer with an ethernet port and plug it into my wireless router   the only devices i have in my household that have ethernet are my xbox and appletv   i haven t owned a laptop desktop in    years than has an ethernet port   so  basically i m screwed   will be returning this asap and purchasing a different model   one that doesn t require a computer from      to fix      
679,5.0 ,                       it extended the wifi  signal from an upstairs gateway to a      square foot basement with no dead spots  getting   bars throughout  except in the bathroom which is at the very end  getting   there can stream youtube without any buffering took about   minutes to set it up using wps  another   minutes to move it to the basement if you have dead spots somewhere with your wifi this is the way to go      
680,1.0 ,                       i m a techie  and almost never have issues with electronic components  however  i have an unsecured router  uncommon  which would not plug and play with this device  despite being wps compatible  i contacted support for what i thought would be a simple solution  after my explaining the issue multiple times to the rep  who had a notable language barrier  i simply gave up and returned the item the fact that netgear wants to charge customers on a subscription basis for this level of support  is simply a slap in the face to the consumer  it s not that my dealing with this was the end of the world  its just simply not the way to run a business and this will be the last netgear product i buy until they change their support and service model to meet the standards for literally       of the rest of the market      
681,5.0 ,                       i am laughing right now  by myself  so i look a little crazy   i have been working from home for the past month and half and having the worst connection problems with my wifi  i live in a small house  router is in the living room  office is not that far  i have called xfinity a million times  and was nice  i promise  wondering what the problem was  finally i ordered this wifi extender on amazon and just set it up and tested my internet speed from my office    i got      mbps download and      mbps upload  i don t speak tech  but my brother does and he says  nice  so i call that a win  just for comparison  i tried to do the internet speed test connected to the router and i kid you not  it literally said   the test can t be completed due to a problem with the network  try again later   lol i  cannot believe this is what i have been working with all this time  sorry this review is so long  i just thought it was too hilarious not to share     definitely recommend buying it before you get as much grey hair as i did      
682,1.0 ,                       maybe i m spoiled with modern technology  but i expect the electronics that i buy to work without having to become some kind of super tech specialist to get them to do what i bought them to do   getting this thing setup was somewhat difficult  but after an hour or so of messing with the router and trying to interpret the instructions i got the thing up and running   the problem now is that we can connect to the extender  and it says that we re connected  but there is no internet flowing  usually  but sometimes kind of   after spending hours trying to dig through online help  and reading through other customers frustrations  i have given up   a couple of days past my return window  of course   if you re a super tech person and enjoy burning hours trying to solve complex technology problems  then this extender will be perfect for you   regular people may want to look elsewhere      
683,1.0 ,                       didnt seem to make a difference as far as connection speed range im using verizon fios gigabit quite often the extender only shows    ghz instead of the  g when i check mywifinet it is set as enabled and my personal laptop always runs on  g so its not a compatibility issue with  g the only real difference was the lan which assisted in boosting up a connection to ps  through alternative methods but could easily be fixed with a   ft ethernet cable running from router through wall to other room s     
684,1.0 ,                       i was really excited about how good it worked for a while  i didn t need it for anything crazy  literally just to scroll through social media and such on my phone in an area where the wifi was a dead zone  it worked really well for a couple weeks  it had a day where it was acting up and all i had to do was unplug it and plug it back in until just a few days ago it straight up just refused to browse the internet  i was still able to connect  but i couldn t even load google  videos wouldn t load  nothing  i factory reset it multiple times  went through the process of making it extend again  within inches of the router  and it still refused to work  there wasn t much else i was able to do  very excited at first  now very disappointed and returning it  maybe you ll be luckier than me  maybe not      
685,5.0 ,                       well  as a long time verizon fios customer  i had a old router that really wasn t cutting it  so i purchased a used newer model router  and this extender  my issue was with streaming on the second floor  router is on the first floor   constant buffering led to not even attempting to watch any streaming internet options  not ideal  anyway the install on this device was so easy  and the signal in the normal weak area improved to full strength  awesome  plus a great deal too      
686,1.0 ,                       i am giving the netgear extender   star not because i think it is a bad extender but because  universally compatible  works with any wifi router for hassle free reliability  is pure marketing hype  it does not work with my at t pace     ac u verse router the extender links with the router just fine  but when you try to do anything  you find you don t have an internet connection  as best i can figure out  the dhcp server in the at t router doesn t play nice with the netgear ex     extender and the device trying to connect to the internet via the extender doesn t get the network configuration data needed to connect to the internet  netgear tech support is fair to middling  they ll nicely walk you through doing a factory reset and following the manual set up procedure to connect the extender to the router but that won t solve the problem my research suggests that all extenders in the netgear line may have this incompatibility with the at t     ac router and probably other routers as well  unfortunately there is no way of knowing if your router is going to work with this extender  if you decide to give this extender a try  don t waste your time troubleshooting if you see the  no internet connection  error  it is not something you are going to solve unless you are a real networking ninja if you have an at t router  you should look at the at t offering of extenders  they claim compatibility with specific at t routers  at least tech support won t have another vendor to point their finger at if there are issues      
687,5.0 ,                       my router is upstairs directly above my living room  even with a relatively good router from comcast  the signal was too weak to game on my ps  and connect on smaller devices such as chromecast  set up was easy  and purchasing refurbished on amazon saved some money  i placed the router in a room where originally the signal was weak or too weak to be detected  i can now game and stream content  up to  k on netflix  with no issues  i regularly play games online  and i ve had no issues connecting  signal now reaches my entire downstairs of my house  including rooms on the side that had absolutely no signal before sidenote  the extender will provide  g and  g bands  i do not have a dual band router  while most would recommend connecting capable devices to the  g band  i ve had the most success using  g only  if you have connection difficulty on  g  try on the  g  for me  this has almost always resolved any issues with speed or connection strength      
688,3.0 ,                       didn t spend a lot on this and needed it for really one reason  my ring doorbell was not getting a strong signal and put this booster on the other side of the exterior wall to give it a good signal  but it really didn t change dramatically  i tested the signal on other devices and they  too  were just mediocre being within five or ten feet  but it s okay      
689,2.0 ,                       this netgear ex     range extender was placed in a hallway electric outlet  approximately    feet from my wifi router and    feet from my smart tv  hopefully to improve reception of netflix   amazon video  but it did not improve those receptions  though i had no direct line of sight between the extender and router  or between extender and tv  the led lights on the extender showed that it was properly installed and operating  my working solution for reception was to add a roku express       streaming device to the tv     voila      success in river city       the reception for netflix and amazon were great  also  i removed the netgear ex     from the hallway with no degradation in reception  go figure         
690,1.0 ,                       i used this extender for   months with no problem  set up was pretty easy and it worked great  after   months i noticed that the power was cutting out  as if it had been turned off  i would unplug it and plug it back in and it would start working again for a few days  then it would cut out  finally it got to the point where it would stay on for less than a minute before shutting down  i tried different outlets  i tried a factory reset  but the problem persisted  i contacted netgear customer service  after waiting on hold for    minutes  i decided to go online and create a case  after calling back with a case number i now waited on hold for    minutes  i explained my situation to the call center representative who told me the unit is defective  i explained it should be under warranty as it is under a year old  during the call we became disconnected  i later received a email from netgear about the open case  the representative indicated that i was having difficulty installing the extender  this is not accurate  i would avoid all netgear products in the future  they clearly do not last and the customer service is horrible      
691,4.0 ,                       plugged in    had to reset it to make it work properly but this is very simple to do  just press a button and it resets  the signal is detected and retransmitted almost immediately  no problems after the one reset well it s been several months now and it seems more and more i need to unplug it and plug it back in to do a sort of soft reset because it stops working frequently  it s become such a problem that i ve had to move it so now it s in an easier to reach area so that i don t have to crawl under my desk to get to it every time  once in a while i have to do a full factory reset and go through the whole process of setting up the network and password  very frustrating when i m in the middle of work and this thing crashes      
692,2.0 ,                       seemed to install per instructions  but once i tried to get into controls to reset factory default passwords and manage access  everything failed  i couldn t access the device via the supplied url or ip address  nor did it show up  as it should have  on my wifi router list of connected devices   additionally  the connection seemed to cycle in and out  making reliability terrible  given that  it s simply been unplugged and will most likely be returned if i cannot get a customer service rep to respond  which  admittedly  is difficult everywhere right now       
693,1.0 ,                       i had extremely high hopes for this product as it is supposed to give off a very good dual band     and   gigahertz signal for wi fi  however  i only managed to get the product to produce a weak    ghz signal which wasn t adequate never mind the fact that i was purchasing it for its   gigahertz capability  i can t speak to the quality of other more expensive units but i would caution you to spend a little more to try a different one rather than to go through the hassle of returning like i am about to      
694,5.0 ,                       after   delivery attempts i finally received it on my  rd try  this wifi extender works with my fios router and depends on the number of walls you are trying to extend the signal  distance from the router is   ft first wall    ft second wall    ft  rd wall where the wifi extender is located at  red router light which is expected    wifi extender is   ft away from the verizon fios modem with my living room laptop     ft away trying to receive signal from the fios modem through   walls with one of them being  ft thick wifi extender is passing signals through a   ft thick wall through the the last wall which is    ft to the last wall  there was no way my my devices in the living room area was going to get wifi signal through   walls from the verizon fios modem  sadly i m only getting      mbps up and down speed in this config due to the  ft thick wall      
695,1.0 ,                       so perhaps a non technical person might have trouble with the initial install  thats understandable  however  even a fairly knowledgeable person with technical experience  would say this device sucks  its hit or miss  not at all as easy as they make it seem   additionally  if you do experience any problems  the so called      customer service number is just a recorded messages  suggesting that if you leave a message someone will call you back asap  thats a joke  ive waiting over an hour  by the time they return my call  i will not be in install mode and would have moved on with my busy day  or just not be home at all  waste of time  i am returning the device  i don t have this much time to spend on one so called simple install      
696,5.0 ,                       i wasn t sure how good or bad this extender would be   i have never had one  i bought this one in particular due to the brand name   the many ratings and the fact that the many ratings were mostly   star   i am really impressed with this unit   it only took a few seconds to set up   i used the wps function  it connected right away and i get full bars anywhere in my house and both front and back yard   i wish i needed another one  i would definitely buy again   i totally recommend this unit      
697,5.0 ,                       i have a netgear nighthawk wifi router  ac      connected at one end of my home   the signal was weak at the other end of the house  bedroom  having to go through two walls and with a    foot distance   i purchased this netgear extender   it was an easy set up that took about three minutes  including finding a good permanent location    i tested it with two different devices and they both got a very good signal      
698,2.0 ,                       this device stated it would boost up to    mbs   the wifi signal output of this device was actually lower that what my home wifi output was   my home wifi signal tested at the extender was     mbs   the output of this device was      mbs   i moved beyond where the extender was setup and my home wifi was     mbs     the extender was       i called tech support  rechanneled my router and finally they told me i would have to buy a much more expensive unit to get closer to my speed   very disappointed     
699,4.0 ,                       i first installed the extender not too far from the basement router   easy to follow the set up instructions   it did extend the wifi range   but  it conflicted with my x    security system   so  i adjusted the x    house code  but no help   i then installed in another outlet  still no help   i did have an unused ethernet cable from the router to the main floor tv already  so i connected the ethernet line to the extender   it took a day or more to finally register the devices to the router   but  it did and it now works perfectly   if i did not have the ethernet connection available  i probably would have returned the extender   so  mixed feelings about the rating of        
700,1.0 ,                       when this wi fi extender works  it won t extend your network more than    feet or so   the extender needs to be fairly close to the router to get a strong signal as others have posted in their reviews  this wi fi extender tends to have a short lifespan   the first one i got from amazon set up fine and worked for about a month   i had it connected wirelessly to a netgear router   at about one month s age  it then stopped connecting to it s devices   cycling power to the extender did no good   i was unable to re do the setup by starting over from square one   amazon replaced the unit for free   the second unit set up and worked ok for about   months   it then failed to serve w fi to it s connected devices   cycling power and resetting the extender did no help   since i now have no desire to attempt to reinitialize this unreliable network extender  it s going in the recycle bin      
701,4.0 ,                       we were having major issues with the wi fi in our apartment   the further we moved away from the router  the weaker the connection became   we actually had no service at all in our bedroom  and i ended up going over the data allowance on our cell phone plan   i was so mad   so we decided to give this a try   it s much more affordable than getting a second router through the cable company  an option which we explored initially  but decided against it once we heard the ridiculous price   and it s easy to set up   you just plug it into any outlet  ideally one that between your router and the  weak spots  in your house  and then you find the new wi fi name in your network list   it will be the same name as your current network with the letters ext at the end  and it will have the same password as your current network   i am giving it   stars because it s not perfect   sometimes we will go offline for no reason  but we re back on within    min or so      
702,2.0 ,                       set up is easy   the connect is good  when it works   it doesn t work often enough to be frustrating   i got this to cover a blind spot in the farthest corner of the house   it has improved the situation  but not solved the problem of the blind spot   a reboot tends to solve it  but still requires resetting this device and the main router it is good enough that i haven t replaced it  so  win  for netgear  but i still have to mess with connection problems weekly      
703,1.0 ,                       although installation instructions are readily available on line  they are confusing to the average semi literate home computer user   however  there are some you tube videos that are quite helpful   the best application of devices of this type is for a wap  wireless access point  that requires a hardwired ethernet connection to your home network   all of this is for naught if the device is defective and the manufacturer s customer support is difficult to understand and  apparently  unfamiliar with the product   this was my experience  i returned the product to amazon who promptly  politely and kindly refunded my purchase price      
704,5.0 ,                       router reception in my parents house is awful so this was their christmas gift  easy to set up and connect devices  now there s wifi on the other side of the house so it prompted me to buy my own  i have netflix through my blu ray players and it hasn t worked in a year  for some reason they couldn t maintain connection with my new router  so i got the extender and have not had a connection problem in   days of non stop watching  literally    days and episode after episode for both players  a lot to catch up on from the year      
705,5.0 ,                       i love this  first of all it is so easy to set up  you just plug it in and go  now i do have a netgear router so i don t know if that makes this easier to set up  but it works like a dream  our home is a little over      sq  ft  my son has his playstation hardwired upstairs in the bonus room and the router is also located in his room   i placed this range extender in the upstairs hallway directly opposite the staircase which according to the range extender was the best place for it to be  i plugged it in and added it to my wireless network and that was all there was to it   it made a huge difference to the start up speed of our home pc and almost eliminated the wifi disconnecting which was super irritating   this is great value for money nad i would highly recommend it to anyone who is tired of their wifi disconnecting on them and having issues with slow running pc s  cell phones  tablets etc etc      
706,4.0 ,                           stars  had installed for   weeks now i needed this because walls were blocking our wifi signal from a computer room to a rec room we added on  getting good signal for streaming movies on our new tv was slow and poor quality  i installed this extender in the dining area about    feet from our wifi router and    feet away from the tv  the extender to the tv has an unblocked line of sight  when we switch to streaming service now  it s up and running in seconds with clear picture   issues that kept me from giving   stars    the set up instructions are vague  i had to do some searches on netgear s webpage to understand why i couldn t connect to the new extended range via wifi  the webpage listed in the printed instructions that come in the box is not a website on the internet  it s a set up screen  it only works when you re connected to the new extended network  i had to connect my computer to the extender with hdmi cord to connect to the newly created extended network  but once i did  set up was quick and easy  done in literally like   minutes    the signal drops out occasionaly  not often  but maybe once a week the extended signal will just cut out and the streaming content we re watching will just stop  the extended will have a red light indicating no wifi signal is available to extend but my  the wifi router shows solid signal  maybe signal quality or something  wait a    seconds and it reconnects  usually a good time for bathroom break or refill your beverage     overall  we are happy with our purchase      
707,4.0 ,                       we were not able to get wifi reliably on our back porch  so i purchased this product to help with that issue  my wifi router is also by netgear  so i hoped installation would be easy  it wasn t easy  but i did  somehow  get the two to work together one of the primary issues was the brief and poor documentation with the router  there are    lights across the router that blink or not  with few people understanding why and the paper thin documentation of little help  what i did not know was that the two lights on the far right were also buttons  at least not until i determined that they were buttons  the small  silly icons above the lights buttons were of no help  nor was the pamphlet shipped with the router  however  i did get the router and extender to link with each other  what should have been simple  took a painful couple of hours the extender did give us much better signal on the back porch  and i could unplug it  plug it into a garage outlet  and get lots of signal to a further corner of our back yard the downside is that the router seems to reduce the speed of the router  as others have stated   i did not notice the speed reduction    percent of the time  i could still stream videos from major sites without issues  however  i download tv shows or movies a couple times per month  download speeds were significantly and very noticeably slower than they had been without the extender  i unplugged the extender  and the download speed increased to its pre extender rate the bottom line is that i recommend this extender  but suggest that you be aware of potential wifi speed reduction  you may never experience the slowdown  but if you do  unplugging or turning off the extender temporarily will solve your problem      
708,5.0 ,                       after reading the reviews  especially the non verified purchasers who left one word reviews   i felt compelled to write my own   the setup for this extender  hopefully you know that it s just an extender  so it s not going to have the same throughput as your modem  is incredibly simple  if you have a wps button on your modem router   the setup took me all of   minutes  including moving it to another room   plug in  wait for the lights to come on  push the wps button on both devices  wait for the connection  for both bands  if necessary   unplug the device  plug it in in another room   boom   that s how easy it was for me now  there is an expected drop off in speed  but i now have a good wi fi signal where i had nearly none   i m able to connect my phone  my amazon fire stick  and my xbox without any problems   spending     on not having to run a cable through the attic and walls      that s a no brainer      
709,3.0 ,                       first off  this thing is very easy to install  you can either go to the website for start up set up or just press the wps button on this and your router and let it connect itself it broadcasts yournetworkname  gext and yournetworkname  gext you can turn off the tick that broadcasts  g through the website start up set up  but it won t turn off the  g broadcast from the network extender  even if i turned off  g on my router  the  gext broadcast is still there with the controversy surrounding  g  i d rather be able to turn it off completely  because    g is still fast enough for what i need      
710,5.0 ,                       my primary wi fi modem router is located downstairs at the far end of the house  signal is fine downstairs but zero signal upstairs  where the bedrooms are   i m pretty sure my kids were going to mutiny until i put one of these extenders in the upstairs hallway  it covers their bedrooms perfectly now   my modem does not have a wps button  so  i had to use the web browser method to configure the extender  it was super simple  i decided to not use the default ssid      ext   instead  i specified the existing ssid  i have read this can cause problems but it s working great for me  devices automatically jump onto the stronger signal  in fact  i ve installed a second extender upstairs  used the same ssid  and it s working perfectly  i have an app on my iphone that measures wi fi signal strength   as i walk thru the   zones  i can monitor the signal strength and actually see the iphone jumping onto the next signal source  it s pretty cool  no complaints from the kids  with all their streaming and gaming and online school stuff so  it s behaving like a pseudo mesh setup  i m very happy with it      
711,5.0 ,                       works like champby michael brown      i am not sure whether i really needed a wifi extender  but we had to move our fios router to the bottom corner of our house because of an upgrade  reception on the far upper story dropped significantly impacting on my son s ipad and samsung smart tv  placing the ex     half way between has restored full service  setting up the extender was easy and all we had to do was to choose which wifi signal was best for each of us based on how we move around the house  an excellent piece of gear      
712,3.0 ,                       not sure what to say about this product  setup was not difficult  not sure if it improved the wifi signal in my house  i have a small home       sq  ft   and thought this item would be powerful enough based on its description but it didn t really help my situation  i ended up buying the google wifi system  single wifi point    router replacement for whole home coverage  it had been recommended to me  i have a combination modem router from my cable company  the google installed very easily  i did not have to make any changes to my modem router  i plugged the google into the rear of my modem router and wow  my download speeds throughout my house are never under    mbps now      
713,5.0 ,                       wow  ug in  hit the wps button on this and router  wait   minute and you re done  you can of course go in and customize things too and even combine the   channels for one channel that works faster too  several options for such a small device and the range is decent but not that fast but will get the job done  don t expect it to help in a huge home but it ll work in say a      sq ft home just fine     i added it to my bedroom extending my ac wifi and plugged in an ethernet cable to it and ran to my shield and it s much snappier since it s not wifi to wifi but wifi to ethernet so it gave it a good     boost or so which is all it needed  much more snappier when streaming and navigating by far  and you can t beat the price     get one      
714,2.0 ,                       after    days the wifi extender started having trouble and now it disconnects every few hours and needs to be constantly reset  it was moved closer to the router  but continues to disconnect  i don t really recommend it as a long term solution  a side note  if you expect this to maintain your internet speeds you are going to be very disappointed  be prepared to see less than   mps on both  ghz and    ghz even though its advertised as capable of    mps  standing beside extender   i have a    mps plan and still even when directly connected to the router it doesn t improve the speeds  the    ghz signal distance is good  but the  ghz is good only when nothing is between the device and wifi extender  being in a room    feet away with door closed drops the  ghz signal from   bars to between   and   then speeds slow down even more  as for the    ghz the signal extends good throughout a   bedroom   story house  but the signal is ridiculously slow  hope this helps      
715,5.0 ,                       i recently helped someone clear out a back building on their property  and upon finishing it became clear that the wifi from the house was almost completely unusable from that room  not available most of the time  and extremely unreliable when a connection could be established  as the room was intended to be an office  establishing working internet was critical  while neither of us had used an extender before  at     we decided to give this one a shot unlike for some other reviewers  the setup process was extremely painless  i first plugged in the extender in the same room as the router  and after it finished booting up used the web portal to register it with the wifi network  i found the instructions in the booklet to be straightforward  though i did use the ip address from the top review                 rather than the url provided to initially connect to the device   the only small hiccup was at the end when the instructions tell you to connect to the new ssid  a separate wireless network name you use to connect to the extender   after which you are supposed to be presented with a screen indicating success  i was able to connect to the new network but it took a few minutes for it to register with netgear s web app  which i had to refresh several times once that was established  i unplugged the extender and moved it to the end of the house facing the backyard  this is a     year old house with who knows what in the walls  and the back building is a good       feet away from it  but with just this extender the formerly unusable wifi was holding strong at a        connection strength  i ran some speed tests on the main network and the extender and found a consistent and perfectly acceptable      loss in download speed and no loss at all in the upload speed  the latency increase was only    ms and more importantly  over the course of a few days now  the wifi connection has remained completely stable during everything from web browsing  to netflix streaming  and even with some light online gaming  highly recommended  if your needs are similar      
716,1.0 ,                       if this review does not convince you to avoid netgear read the additional reviews from other customers i have listed at the bottom   if after reading those you purchase a netgear product you are getting what you deserve   i thought netgear would be a solid choice for an extender and was totally unprepared for the very big scam attempt that transpired   my intention is not only to give   star for this device  but to warn people away from netgear at all costs   just as context i am tech literate enough for a simple device setup after    years as a database specialist   in a nutshell setup requires that the extender become  aware  of your router so that it can repeat extend your signal   page   of the booklet that comes in the box with the device is titled  connect with web browser setup    please see the attached photo   step   directs you to a page for  new extender setup screen  and tells you to click   new extender setup  button    but instead you are on what looks to be a netgear page  but no new extender setup info and almost immediately an unsolicited support chat opens     i did not realize it  but it was a phishing robot masquerading as a human and soliciting info which led to a tech calling me    at this point i am surprised and amused at how bad this support is  but not suspicious    until shady tech calls  using name that his parents are not possibly aware of  and will not answer my question about why the instructions do not match the page and why do i need an expert for something this simple  he essentially tried to convince me that customers are stupid     then    without the explicit warning and permission that any legit support tech for a legit tech company will provide and make sure the customer understands and agrees to   goes into full scam mode and tries to trick me into giving him access to my computer    wtf    i confronted him and he actually got tough and tried to defend his actions    again i am at the very least tech literate  but was not on my guard due to the origin of this transaction being the netgear quick start booklet      seriously i am sure lots of people get hooked on this     see the sept        star review telling the same story  with a comment for another customer who advised same thing and was scammed for        netgear is not a legit tech company as there is no way they do not know this is going on   amazon as well bears some responsibility   do yourself a favor and bypass netgear products   btw i tried a number of ways to get in contact with someone at netgear for their side of the story before posting this review  but it was impossible and i went in circles for over an hour   if you are still thinking of buying netgear then read         review by chu          by miller          monteith          hughes or         with  beware  in title    one says that scam tech support actually left them with a non functional pc      
717,1.0 ,                       i ordered this product brand new but when i received it one side of the box had been taped together  i still tried it and it took me a while to install it because  unbeknownst to me  it had already been set up with some other network name  so i had to reset back to factory to get it setup properly i only decided to keep the product and set it up because the device itself looked like it was brand new  but somebody had clearly already opened it and set it up  so   star for everything except the wifi signal which is decent      
718,1.0 ,                       i bought this to extend our wifi signal for my sons xbox which is far from the router and up   floors in the house   i could only get it to connect to the    ghz connection of our tp link router   tried everything to connect to the    ghz connection but no luck   i used a computer and the wizard and everything seemed simple enough to connect but in the end it just didn t work like i had hoped  the router is the middle of the basement and we have    mb download speed on the  st floor   we have   mb download speed available on the  nd floor but it drops off quickly as you walk    feet to the far corner of the playroom with the xbox  above the garage    i placed this device on the  nd floor landing where the signal is very strong and it didn t help the xbox connection when i ran the diagnostic test on the xbox itself   ended up returning it      
719,3.0 ,                       when its actually connected it works wonders but it is a massive hassle when it disconnects  for mac users the notice   this device has a self assigned ip address  keeps appearing in the status bar and this prevents a connection which in turn requires a very annoying and complex workaround to get it operational  even after connection is established the signal is nowhere near what it needs to be example basement office without only receives  mbps download   terrible  with this device it boosts to       average so not much of a gain there  iv used a different product for lesser value that increased my speeds beyond     which is amazing     
720,5.0 ,                       seems to be a great product  i did have a bit of a problem getting it connected to my wifi  i haven t had to contact tech support so i don t know what that experience is like  i think it took me   times of pushing the wps button like instructed  or    minutes to get it connected and working  not sure if that is normal  i did something out of sequence  or something else happened  but it started working and i haven t had to deal with it since  that s been about two months   i plugged it in or installed it next to the door to my garage so it can connect to my tv  hulu  in the garage  my router is actually on the other side of the house  basic   bedroom   bath house  nothing large and elaborate  and it works fine  like i said  i haven t had to mess with it since the initial    minute startup      
721,1.0 ,                       i purchased this product to extend my wifi  i am somewhat technology savy and followed the directions to a t and i get it so that you can see on your wifi device often with   out of   bars  but don t be fooled its super slow and doesn t extend anything in fact i found that disconnecting it gave me better reception from my router since this device wasn t hogging up the bandwidth  don t buy you are wasting your money      
722,1.0 ,                       when i set this product up i found out that it requires that you use an email to set the product up  this is the first time i have ever had any network device demand my email address more annoying then this was the fact that the product is slow  in my living room i could get    mbps but in my bedroom i could only get   mbps so i thought an extender would help  the extender actually decreased my speed to   mbps  maybe this will increase range but that range will be even slower then before      
723,4.0 ,                       best professional home entertainment installer and sound and video technician this wi fi extender allows me to receive signal where my components installed and need signal can recieve it   i buy in bulk just cause every job im challenged with wufi connections  thanks for such a wonderful product  it helps believe me      
724,2.0 ,                       purchased this from amazon when it was on sale and since i m a netgear fan  i thought it would integrate well with my netgear router  it was very easy to install but   the advertised range for this extender is very questionable  fifty feet from my router  i could not even connect my ring device to the extender except on    ghz  i thought the unit was defective and contacted amazon to replace it  this turned out to be a fiasco  not only was the customer rep  not going to refund me for the full amount that i paid but amazon had increased the price on the device by another         feeling frustrated  i finally gave up talking to someone with poor communication skills  especially in english  and decided to just use the    ghz as it limps along and i purchase a stronger wifi extender from walmart      
725,4.0 ,                       got a wifi dead spot in your house  netgear solves the problem   while using my wireless speakers  samsung radiant r   i found one speaker not performing well due to a weak wifi signal in my dining room  router is upstairs on second floor    i purchased this dual band extender and although i could not place it where i wanted  out of sight  it is doing a remarkable job   i must admit that the install was not quick  since my router does not have a wpa button   i had to go online and do the install   first attempt failed but the help link solved the problem   took an extra minute or two for the install   now i have the extender plugged in my dining room and all of my samsung speakers  four  work flawlessly  my wifi is better all around the house and my iphone and ipad work faster and have no connection loss due to a weak wifi signal   i have time warner cable and have been working with their customer service off and on trying to improve my wifi signal and have had no real success until i plugged in the netgear wifi extender  it works very well  what else can i say      
726,3.0 ,                       i had to write this review for folks to whom the speed bandwidth matters  this is for netgear ac    wifi range extender  ex        nas   i have a     mbps connection  i can verify that while connected to the  ghz wifi or hardwired via lan cable  the setup process was very easy and very informative   i should give some compliments for that  even a non technical person can set this up very easily  i created   new wifi ssids   one for the  ghz and another for the   ghz band  i sat exactly in between both the routers  the personal one i had and the netgear extender    feet to be exact   i made sure there are no interferences on the channel i was connecting  when i connected to netgear  the max speed i got from various speed test results were between     to     mbps  when connected to my original router  i still got my     mbps plan speed  to extend the testing results  i moved the netgear extender some    feet away from my personal router  the speed went south between    to     mbps  so  to conclude  netgear definitely dropped     to     of my original speed inspite of no channel interference  so  for folks who  just  need connectivity and don t care about speed to read emails and watch videos  i certainly recommend this product  but for folks who want to get maximum juice out of their internet to stream  k videos  this product will not help you  i hope this review meant something to someone  this is just my personal experience  i give this a   star   god bless pros  easy to set up  very informativegood product for not so picky internet userscons doesn t give you the original speed as advertised      to     loss in speednot recommended for speed hungry internet users     
727,5.0 ,                       two of these  placed one in the basement  one in a hallway  eliminated entirely all of my connectivity issues  wireless  speaking   though they do not tell you to do this  i recommend changing each to it s own sub net  from             to         xxx     so each has it s own subnet   then also  set the ssid to be the same as your router   not different  as the instructions say   by doing this  and then telling all devices to automatically choose the best signal  you will see that everything keeps on working seamlessly      
728,3.0 ,                       we bought this to help run a projector outside and be able to use our phones on wifi at the fire ring   signal did extend further but it  goes in and out  when the signal is in  it s not as strong as i thought it would be   not real empresses      
729,5.0 ,                       updated  just call amazon support for help   i m given them     stars  she helped me better than netgear support and was extremely patience with me  the wifi extender now works perfect    thank you so much amazin tech support  she deservs a raise  had issues setting up  called netgear tech support they seemed to help until asked to go into my laptop  then claimed it was my laptops issues and for       they could fix the issue on my laptop in order to have the netgear work  in process of using amazon support tech and if not able to fix issues a simple return it is      
730,1.0 ,                       this product only connected with my comcast high speed router after many tries   even when plugged in adjacent to my router  this speed of this extender was only         the speed of the router   this got worse when i actually moved the extender to a part of my house that had a weak signal   i was better off connecting my devices directly to the router and dealing with the weak signal      
731,1.0 ,                       after following what appeared to be straight forward instructions to dead end or circular web sites  i managed to set up an account    points for gryffindor  just to get past the set up page took hours  which ultimately landed me on a page with all of these options to buy or try a bunch of fee services either from netgear or their approved vendors what the what    the range extender was still not working and the company was trying to upsell me on more stuff  that takes a lot of balls i got in touch with netgear s it department  the technician took control of my pc   it really makes me nervous to turn over my pc over to a third party  the guy tried to get the device to work but could not figure out the hitch  just when he was going to upsell me on a service that might fix the problem  i told him we were done and that this netgear pos was going back the following day perhaps all of this trouble is by design  just to sell customers crap they don t need and did not ask for  but it comes as no surprise that the unit was reduced       from the time i bought it on amazon to when i received it the following day the entire experience was sketchy tomorrow i dump my netgear stock too      
732,2.0 ,                       this item was easy to set up but that s the only good thing i could say about it  this was suppose to speed up my devices but no  the netgear  range extender might help if you are having very bad big reception problems some part of your house but not to just improve reception because it runs at about half the speed of a router  my netgear router runs at about   mbp but the extender only      mbp  i went to the web site to see if it needed an update and to register it but that proved to be a nightmare  it wouldn t let me register it after several tries to update i gave up  how can a company that makes internet equipment have such a poor web site    you can call and talk to a tech to help you get you through all the crap but for now i m fed up and unplugged it and tossed it on a shelf     for sale     
733,1.0 ,                       this product is awful  i have yet to be able to use it   it does not connect to my wifi network as it is supposed to do  i have followed the instructions to a t and no luck  i finally reached out to customer service after searching aimlessly for a telephone number and then being placed on hold for    minutes  the individual took my name and email address but could not assist me  he said that he was just setting up my profile  this process took  o minutes itself  i then asked when would i be connected to technical support and he said soon  i then asked would i be placed on a wait list again and he said no  he then said he was transferring me to a technician which made me happy but i was then unhappy when i realized that he placed me on another wait list for the technician  i am now waiting all over again for    minutes so far      
734,5.0 ,                       we love this so much we ordered one for my brother  it has helped tremendously with not only boosting the internet signal but also speed  we re relying on a hotspot device due to the unavailability of high speed internet in our rural area  we can now download movies and use the on demand feature on our satellite subscription  we live in a      sq ft brick home that makes it harder to receive signal without antennae or boost it without the extender      
735,1.0 ,                       the configuration and user interface for this device is terrible     times it could not connect to the router saying the password was invalid and yet the  th time it connected   after configuring it with the same password as the router  and connecting to the extended ssids  both     and  ghz  it said the password was invalid   after selecting the  invalid  password  cutting it to the clipboard and pasting it back into the entry field  it accepted the exact same  invalid  password   i bought it over a year ago and never used it instead using a different solution   now to late to return it   stuck with poor device the firmware upgrade bricks the device   buyer beware         
736,5.0 ,                       this was shipped and arrived much quicker than i expected it to  which was a nice surprise   i have to admit that it was somewhat challenging to get it setup   it kept telling us to go to a site and a login page would come up   except when we would go to that page  there was no login there   so my husband tried doing it on his kindle and it worked   he was able to get connected and it worked   the first place we installed it didn t get a good signal   so we moved it into the living room and it began working perfectly   we are so please with how much faster it has made my computer   this is one little gadget that really does what it s supposed to      
737,1.0 ,                       between the fact the unit itself is hot when running  the terrible  ghz reception  i can t get it to make a usable connection to my router  from a few feet away  when my laptop can get a usable signal across most of the house   the ridiculous requirement you supply it  and netgear s marketing department  a real email address  which you ll use to log in to the thing   the tortuously slow web admin site  the lack of a seamless handover  it appears as two separate networks   and the fact it works as two separate routers  you can t route both  ghz and  ghz through the  ghz connection to the router  for example  not that the  ghz connection works   i really can t recommend this extender  i ended up giving up using it for its primary purpose  and it currently serves as a  very inefficient  given the  ghz band is barely usable  wifi bridge      
738,1.0 ,                       i didn t have a lot of problem hooking it up  though the web page could stand to be rewritten after watching a user try to follow it   but a problem began about    days after my purchase   i began to have connection issues   it would drop the internet signal for no possible reason except overheating the unit gets really hot  i live in an air conditioned house and the unit is downstairs where it is even cooler  there is plenty of air flow   but it keeps happening  i need to get it fixed by my next meeting in less than a week since the problem is now    days past the purchase date  amazon can t help   they gave me netgear tech support number and website  the web site is not helping since the unit won t respond to the prompts over the network  and netgear claims it has overwhelming call volume i presume they suffer from covid    hiring practices  that is  cut payroll and employees to save cost  lengthen phone waits and hope for the best  in any case  who can sit on the phone    minutes or more   do you think you are microsoft  netgear should be ashamed of itself i ve read complaints about overheating of this unit from others and it still is a problem   don t buy it   don t expect help   now i have to go through the expense of hard wiring cat   to my downstairs computer this is the worst experience i have had as a long time amazon customer      
739,4.0 ,                       since we have a   story house and the internet modem and router is downstairs where the cable connection is located  i wanted a device that would allow us to get extended range upstairs and in the garage  this is paired with a netgear n    wdr     and was easy to set up and use  i tried placing it in different locations and settled on the location where it seemed to provide the maximum range to all the rooms upstairs and in the garage  since installing it  we have been able to receive good  uninterrupted wi fi connection in those places  whereas before it was intermittent  i didn t rate it a five because it took some experimentation to find the best  most consistent location to place it      
740,4.0 ,                       i can t fault this too much because it wasn t very expensive  i could not get it to set up automatically  after   tries i gave up and set it up manually through their website  the directions were clear and easy to follow and it did set up immediately once i did that  the range wasn t great and it did eat up a lot of bandwidth  i did get two bars in my garage  but i was hoping for more  even without the range extender i sometimes got two bars      
741,1.0 ,                       i noticed that the speed was very slow using this extender so i went to their site and click update  it did not work anymore  then i downloaded the last update and the only files  the zip file has is a file ending in   chk  ex     ex     v                chk  and a html file  i have rebooted my computer  plugged the extender right next to my router and tried    or more times to reset the connection with the router and i get a      page not found  do not buy this product  bought it in october      for    dollars and they want me to pay    dollars for phone support      
742,5.0 ,                       i was skeptical  experiences in the past with range extenders were disappointing  either they didn t extend the range or the signal was so slow as to be useless  i took a chance with the      because of the reviews it greatly extended the range of the router to areas of the house that literally had no wifi  i havent done a speed test but the speed doesn t seem to be degraded   an alienware pc and a mac book pro  the setup was painless and quick  plug the extender in  pick which signal you want  enter the password for your wifi  done  could not be easier   i d recommend this extender to anyone      
743,5.0 ,                       let me start off by saying i know close to nothing about wifi setup or any of its technical terms  but this device was so easy to set up  we live in a one bedroom apartment and for some reason our wifi signal can never reach our smaller devices  phones  tablets  in our back room  even though our router is only on the other side of the wall in the living area  because of this we decided to buy this netgear wifi extender  the directions were very easy to follow  i chose to set mine up using my laptop since i knew my wifi name and password already  but if you don t know your wifi name and password you can still set this extender up using the wps button on the extender and your router i just plugged in the extender in the closest outlet to my router  opened my wifi manager screen on my laptop clicked the one the directions told me too and then the setup window opened  i just followed the steps it told me too  after it was finished setting up i unplugged the extender from the outlet and moved it into my bedroom and connected all my devices to it  works great for streaming video and gaming highly recommend this product      
744,2.0 ,                       review i tried this and was disappointed i live in an      sq  ft  apartment with a fairly average layout  master bedroom down a short hall from the living room which has an office nook where the modem and router live along with the personal computing equipment i have an apple airport extreme bade station that i use as a router for all my wireless devices  which is setup on bridge mode and plugs into my arris modem from charter m  as i am a subscriber to their spectrum service my airport extreme does fairly well throughout the majority of the apartment  but due to the layout of the walls  going into the master suite causes the wifi signal to rapidly fade as you approach the back wall  which is a straight shot from the door  no more than    far away i purchased this wifi range extender in hopes of curing this problem  i was sorely disappointed  if my phone or tablet  or the wife s  managed to actually connect to the extension network  it was slow and spotty at best  often times seeing no actual improvement over the main network using a wifi mapping app only revealed what i suspected  the wifi was being broadcast strongly enough measuring in db  but my phone didn t operate as if this was the case  in most areas where it showed my devices as having a strong signal  the download speed was still drastically below the  up to  speed  and noticeably slower than the normal speed i gauged on speed test sites i promptly returned this device as it did not solve any of the issues i had  and even created more as when i would be in the living room near the ai report router  i would still be connected  with a strong signal  no less  to the netgear network  with little to no actual internet connection  the hassle of having to go into settings and manually disconnect and reconnect to the different networks was not worth the     i paid on amazon after taxes      
745,5.0 ,                       i was having tons of issues with my modem and router  this lead me trying out a bunch of new wireless options  eventually i ended up returning all the routers i bought and to upgrading my modem  unfortunately the wifi signal from the new modem wasn t reaching as far as the old set up  after trying a  few different routers and modem options i decided to buy one of these extenders  i got the dual band version and my life is so much better now  i cant believe i didn t buy one of these sooner  the set up was very easy and it plugs into a wall outlet so its very discreet  so far i have had no troubles with the extender  set up was very simple and was completed within minutes  the dual band set up is great  i love having a  g extension for my phone and laptop as well as having a   g connection for my television   update   in the beginning i had a couple of instances where the connection got reset and i was prompted to go through the set up wizard again  i thought the unit was defective but i realize now it may have been an operator error  the hallway that i have the extender plugged into is narrow so it may have been bumped and come unplugged by someone passing  the issue has gone away and i have not had to go through the set up wizard again  i am very thrilled with the product  i still can t believe it took me so long to buy one of these in the first place  i don t know how i lived without one      
746,5.0 ,                       this review is on   purchases that arrived at the same time  i ordered both to compare    netgear ac     wifi extender   t p ac     wifi extenderboth about same pricenetgear  st  connected with wps button  but could only connect to  g only  had to dig out the laptop to set it up with each band   g    g  pretty straight forward  took around    minutes  i mounted in garage    feet away from home router  i m using fios by frontier          on  g  it does       on  g up and running so its time for speed test  i tested both bands   times to get an average   g was    down     up   g was     down     up tp link ac    wps took   minutes to marry up  i did the double wps but didn t get the  g band  had to go to website   set it up manually with passwords  no big deal  still an easy process  time to test speed  unplugged netgear   put tp in same wall plug  tested again like above  both bands   times for average     down     up on  g     down and    up on  g the netgear outperformed the tp by almost   times the speed  my purchase was to speed up reaction time to   isp cameras  scrolling thru both cameras  the netgear extender made the reaction time much faster both extenders were mounted    feet under the cameras  so the signal strength was      on both every situation is different  that s why i bought   different brands to test  i ll put the tp in the bedroom so the wife can have it  i m sticking with the netgear for performance         
747,5.0 ,                       super simple to setup using the wps button on my router and this extender   took only  a few minutes to connect and then logged in to do make some more advanced settings   one thing it didn t do was extend both my    g and  ghz networks   only the    gh backhaul was established  i had to manually go in and connect the  ghz backhaul to my router   interface is simple and clean and has some advanced on off functionality based on day date time of day and access controls i already have   wireless ap s but needed to get a better signal out to my shed in my backyard to stream appletv and plex media videos to my large screen in my man cave performance  i have it setup on a window sill facing my backyard where the shed is about    feet away   backhaul from extender seem to be pretty decent   extender to remote wifi devices seemed to always report poor performance  even installed in next room over  see image capture  even with red status  i was still getting about    to   mbps connections  more than enough to stream hd quality videos to the shed       
748,1.0 ,                       completely unnecessary and overcomplicated  nobody should have to sign up for a netgear account in order to configure consumer level networking hardware  a range extender or wireless bridge is not a complicated device  don t buy this  if you ve set up a traditional router before  then just get a small router with ddwrt preinstalled and put it in bridge mode  i regret not trusting my gut      
749,2.0 ,                       the device functions  but barely  it works fine if it s next to the wifi router  if i place it a room over to help extend the signal  it will fluctuate the boosted signal strength from anywhere between    to      it remains wildly inconsistent and unreliable  i am hesitant to even bother trying another extender when i already have a cat  cable and a power drill i can run through the basement  in either case  this device was a waste of time and money  two stars simply because it occasionally does boost the signal  if barely      
750,5.0 ,                       i have never used an extender before so i was concerned that the setup and connectivity would be difficult to manage  however  this was one of the easiest products to setup and use that i have ever installed  the entire process including reading the directions took only about    minutes from start to finish the extender has enhanced the wifi signal throughout the   rooms where it was needed and has greatly improved the viewing of streaming on our televisions  additionally it has improved wifi cell phone capability and computer capability i would recommend this product to a friend      
751,2.0 ,                       we got this about   months ago   worked ok for what we needed it to do   had trouble setting it up  but eventually got it up and running   it also  as other reviewers have said  runs very hot   was never able to connect to the  ghz network   it would show it was up  but when you tried to connect a device it said no internet connection       ghz was up and able to connect to   the device started to fail a week ago   it lost all of its settings  so we had to set everything back up again   it worked for   days  then we were unable to connect anything to it   it showed the wifi was up  but nothing was able to connect   went to contact customer support  but was told it was out of warranty and we would have to pay for support   we saw it has a year warranty  wrote an email to tech support and asked for a replacement   they then replied saying they would like to help us   talked to support  went through the troubleshooting and none of it worked   they offered a replacement if we paid to ship the defective one back to them   decided not to get a replacement from them  and are going with another product that will work better hopefully      
752,3.0 ,                       i bought this because of the rave reviews but in my experience it doesn t extend the wifi signal as far as expected  i bought it to use with my outside security system and it extended the signal about    feet  setup was a bit confusing but once i found the correct instructions it was a breeze  looks good  built solid  just wish it had better performance      
753,1.0 ,                       no matter how i set this extender up it would not extend the  g network from my net gear router  the extender showed it was connected to the  g signal with a      signal strength but no matter what configuration i tried through the fast link software for the extender it would not extend the  g network  i went online and i am not the only one experiencing this issue  seems to be connected to the latest firmware update  koodo s to amazon who has a great return policy      
754,5.0 ,                       i realized i needed an extender when i was in different areas of my home  because i have wifi through comcast i called them to say i was experiencing dead areas in our home  they suggested i go to their local xfinity store and pay      for a package of   wifi extenders  i said i only need one  of course they don t just sell one  now that i knew exactly what i needed i came straight to amazon and bought the netgear range extender and it s perfect  very easy to set up which was my biggest worry  the price was amazing and now i can sit on my patio and work on my devices with no issues whatsoever  very happy i didn t waist      on   extenders i didn t need      
755,1.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       this is such a crappy product  first of all i have asus ac     router which broadcasts both    ghz and  ghz  i need to extend both of them  netgear ac    advertises that it can extend both of them under different ssid such as your  original ssid ext   so under basic settings  it grabs both    ghz and  ghz from asus ac     and translates both    ghz and  ghz under different ssid which is fine  however only    ghz works and  ghz will say no internet connection on the extension networks  so  reading other comments i came to conclusion that it cannot translate both at the same time fine  screw    ghz since it s overcrowded anyways  let s try to extend  ghz only  netgear has fastlane technology option which broadcasts only one band  and it has two options     catch    ghz band and rebroadcast as  ghz     catch  ghz and rebroadcast as    ghz  there is no  ghz to  ghz rebroadcasting option meaning no matter what option you choose  your speeds are bottlenecked at    ghz  this is plain dumb  i don t know why on earth i need to rebroadcast    ghz as  ghz if it is bottlenecked at    ghz anyways when it travels from asus ac     to netgear ac    conclusion  no matter what  it will not extend  ghz network  grabbing  ghz and rebroadcasting  ghz   i tried both original firmware and i tried resetting after upgrading to the latest firmware   product behaves the same way additionally  this netgear ac    has such a week signal  i am sitting on my laptop and iphone right next to it and signal is worse than if i am connected to asus ac     which is in a different room across the wall  in other words the area where i want extend my wifi is covered better with my original router which defeats the purpose of this extender images are included     
756,1.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       i have been using this extender for   months now  it has been working fine until today  i was trying to update the firmware  but for some reason the connection between my computer and the extender was disrupted in the middle  always a big no no   afterwards  the green power light keeps blinking  i read online that this is a sign of firmware corruption  a few more searches revealed a solution from netgear  i followed every step of the instructions  but that did not work for me  after manually setting the ip address for the extender  i was able to ping the ip address from command prompt  but nevertheless i was unable to reset the firmware using the tool provided   frustrated  i was trying to contact netgear to to seek help  i bought the extended in sept       and now it s may       so i m still under warranty  as confirmed on my netgear account   however  to my surprise  they provide free phone support only within the first    days of purchase  in order to talk with someone  i need to pay        for their  premium technical support   this is bullshit  i m not going to pay to talk to tech support for an item still under warranty  and much less to pay        for an extender i purchased for        that s it   i will never use netgear ever again      
757,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       chose this after a bit of study  braced myself for the install  have     and  g optic fiber bands which laughed audibly at my old repeaters  need signal on three floors of old house  please pardon the trouble  giant telecom company  router needs to be n close proximity to biggest  most fabulous tv downstairs that we stream from  and in line with home office  thank you  anyway  followed the repeater instructions  while keeping in mind the tips from the it guy who posted a review here   plugged this little baby in in near the router  waited nervously for it to connect   ah    and then pressed the wpa button on this then my router  they chatted for a bit  then  bing  connected  repeated procedure  little longer wait  then  bing   g connected  apparently   shut the repeater off  took it up two floors  and plugged it in near my office computer  minute later  green lights  yass  now my computer found four networks  two were extensions from this device  just type in your router password and click   connected  no issues whatsoever  of course  i speed tested each one  because as you probably know  the number of bars is no reflection of the speed when you use a repeater  for me  the extended  g connection was the winner   is blazing fast  and the install was  dead simple    i think it took five minutes  very happy and delighted  highly recommend   will update if there is a need       
758,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       summary  easy to set up  functional and useful for extending wi fipros  expands both         ghz networks  can be used as an extender  wi fi repeater  or access point  wired   inexpensive  two antennascons  defaults to name of new networks by adding ext to the end  see setup notes below   extends at a combined max speed of     mbps  but honestly  that s fast enough i really like this range extender  it s a great product for a great price  my only gripe is that you aren t told anywhere in the manual how to extend your network without creating additional network names  if your network is named  mynetwork  the extender will default to a network name of mynetwork ext this means your devices will have to disconnect from your first network to pick up the new one  it s not seamless and affects tablets  phones  etc  it also means you occasionally stay connected to the weaker network    this can be avoided  however  by doing the following start by plugging the extender into an outlet in the same room as your router  do not user the wps setup  instead  follow the setup steps for using your computer  or device  when you get to naming the network s   just use your existing wi fi network name s  and password s  for the extender network s   when you finish  it will say you aren t connected any longer but don t worry at this point  unplug the extender and move it to where you want to extend your network  you ll want it to be at least   bars to reliably extend your devices on your device s   turn the wi fi of and back on  let it reconnect and you ll see it pick up your original network  but with a stronger signal now your device will seamlessly transfer from your original router to the extender and back at this point  this is a   star product  i ll assess it s functionality and reliability over the next   months and adjust my review if needed      
759,1.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       i used an old netgear ex     which was     ghz only   worked great  easy to use  fast speed  great range   simple as can be   so naturally i turned to this unit with     and   ghz this one sets up more or less the same  except unlike the older unit you now have to sign up for an account and jump thru hoops that are unnecessary  a bother if you reset the unit  and only of benefit to netgear  not you the customer of netgear so next problem was side by side with the old unit my     ghz band speeds were only     as good as the old one   even in the same room as the router where signal strength was a non issue   maybe i just had a bad one  but i suspect the processor inside is over burdened to handle two bands rather than one the   ghz band was faster  when it worked  which it mostly didn t   it was simply intermittent   again even in the same room as the router so no signal strength problems   i reset and started over a few times   hurray  the sign in with netgear hoop jumping is so convenient     not   but that wasn t it   it would work a few minutes   not work for long stretches  and then sometimes work again   mostly     or     of the time the   ghz band just wasn t working so i returned it   try something else   i don t have a suggestion for a good dual band extender   the beauty of the old one was small size  simple and good speed   plug it in a wall socket  set it up  and have great extender results   you hardly noticed it was even there   in the mean time i m using some old ubiquiti nanostations which are way overkill and not un noticeable to plug into a hallway socket halfway across my house      
760,1.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       the  extender  could not boost the signal beyond the original range of the wifi router we had  most annoyingly  it renames the home network the extender broadcasts  making it necessary to log in to the  new  extender network to benefit from the signal boost in that part of the house  not very practical if you happen to be walking around and go from a strong signal area to a weak one covered by the extender  you ll have to log off the original network  and log in to the  new  extender network  might not be an issue if you have a wifi connected device that will remain stationary  returning this device for one that doesn t rename the network  and really extends the signal      
761,3.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       i wanted to love this thing  but sadly i just like it  it gave me internet access where i didn t have it before  it s a cheap option for extending internet access  but not nearly as good as a long range router  or adding a second wired router  for sure buy it if money is an issue  or running a cable and adding a second router is not possible it does work  but it cuts out a lot  i figured it would  i have used these in the past  and it seems they all do it  maybe it s just the price range  or maybe just the nature of the beast  but it is frustrating  transmitting through a wall greatly reduces its effectiveness also  avoid this if possible  if you re in the same room as the extender with no walls in the way  it works pretty good  it s easy to get a full signal with no obstructions  although it s only as strong as the source signal it still randomly cuts out though regardless of your proximity  but increases as you get further away i do like the fact it broadcasts in     and   ghz simultaneously  very handy if you have new and older devices  you can also give each channel it s own password if you want  even if the source internet signal is unprotected  setup is super easy  i did everything through the browser and had it up and running in about   minutes  both channels password protected  you can name the channels whatever you want  completely unrelated to the source channel name  i use this at work so i like that feature  that way no one trys to connect to my channels thinking they are part of the business anyway it works well when it works  useful features  just cuts out  if you plan to do anything streaming  videos music   you will need to be in an unobstructed path to the extender      
762,4.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       i was under the impression this unit was compatible with both  g and  g networks  i was unable to get it to extend my  g i live in a single story home with both  g and  g networks  the  g works great in the great room  location of the router   but we could not get coverage at the other end of the house  thus i purchased the extender original setup seemed straightforward  per instructions  i connected to the  g network first  then repeated the steps for the  g  at the end of setup  i could see   networks  both original    g networks plus   extended networks  and the  g extension  worked in the front of the house     however i was unable to connect to the original  g after completion  i would be prompted for the password but it was not accepted  i reset the device but only created a  g extension     this reset the  g network which now works  iow  i ended up with     original    g and  g extended  but i was expecting a  g extended it may be that i misunderstood the capabilities so take this with a grain of salt pros  stupid simple setup  successful extension of our  g network to the opposite end of the house cons  unable to extend  g network      
763,3.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,                       context  i live in an apartment with a built in router  but it is located in a closet and that means i have terrible wifi connection in my room on the opposite side of my apartment  that is why i bought this  i m beginning to regret it  this is my horror story access point setup  the directions state that after you plug this into an outlet  wait for the green light  and plug the ethernet cable into a lan port and it will automatically create a new wifi hotspot to set up  easy enough  i plug it in and wait  the wifi hotspot never sets itself up  the router indicator never lights up  instructions already unclear on step two  trying to connect to their mywifiext router website never works  what a disappointment   but there is another way  as the prophecy foretells  also a nitpick  the instructions say to plug in the ethernet cable after the power indicator goes from red to green  you wait    seconds once it s on  not a big deal right  well the on off button is on the opposite side of the ethernet port  so if you are an idiot  read  me   you will press this button by accident several times trying to plug the ethernet in  meaning you gotta wait for that stupid indicator to go green each time you make this mistake  torture device   extended mode setup  okay so the access point setup is confusing  maybe this set of instructions will be easier   spoiler  no press the wps button and run to your router and do the same there  if it doesn t work  which it won t the first few times   try and try again  and don t forget to not accidentally press the on off button which is right next to the damn wps button on this extender  designed to be a torture device   after traveling between the router and your extender for what feels like a mile run that i haven t done since college  the router indicator should finally show green by now the device should work in  extender mode  but you realize that it s not any better than connecting directly to your wifi in your room  no  you want what you  paid  for  you are an over achiever  you want that failed access point set up to work and you deserve it  so let s try that again access point set up  part two  return of the sith   so let s type in that mywifiext website that the instructions say and try again  will the website work  of course not  dummy  read me   you can t use chrome for this  you need to be in safari  i m glad the instructions totally fail to mention this so your cave man oogah boogah brain will keep trying in chrome expecting a different result each time once the website works in safari  the website will show a big purple button saying  new extender mode    no  why isn t there a big fat purple button saying new access point  fine  have it your way  let s press it  it forces you to create a new account and some privacy questions  great  another data breach target  let s fill that out  it tells you the extender is successfully set up  wonderful  except i still want the access point setup  clicking next will direct you to the net gear website  not so fast  let s go back and see what the wifi extender website looks like and see if there is something we can do about that access point now  my instincts tell me to update the device firmware  don t listen to my instincts  you already know i m an idiot  when you download the firmware  and begin to set the router up  chances are the download and installation will take longer than   minutes to install  and you know what happens when you idle on the router webpage for   minutes  you disconnect during the firmware update  it bricks your wifi extender you spent your whole night setting up  ahem  so you repeat most of the steps from the very beginning and reach this point  and this time do not update the firmware  i mean you can  if you don t idle    but i believe i have ptsd now and i don t dare to try lest i be abused by this device and it s poor instructions again the extender webpage does not show any tabs or options to set up the access point at this point  by the way so if you know how to set up the access point  please bless me with your infinite wisdom because i am not smarter than a fifth grader  apparently i hope my review helped you make a decision on what device to buy  if i could travel time  i d go back and stop myself from trying to install this and yeet it out the window  or just tell myself to buy a different device entirely     because it  works   just not as easily as i hoped
