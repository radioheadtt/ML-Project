0,5.0,                       so far so good  this was purchased as an early christmas gift  the enter key and space bar design make for a very comfortable gaming keyboard  the keyboard itself has a matte finish over the keys  making them comfortable and easy to use  the extra keys are super nice as well  one of them along the top will open your my computer folder with just the touch of a button  its function keys are akin to almost having a laptop keyboard for your desktop  allowing for easy access to things just from your keyboard  rather than needing to constantly adjust your speakers to your computer  or vice versa  the mouse is a little bulkier than we are used to  but it has good response times and the buttons are springy and respond well on both keyboard and mouse  overall would recommend as a good budget gaming mouse keyboard combo      
1,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          i love the color setup on the keyboard and how you can choose to turn it off  on  and  breathing mode  where it phases in and out   the colors are preset and do not change on the keyboard   the mouse does change colors but from what i can tell there is no option to pick   color and stay on it   i ll be setting this set up on my daughter s gaming pc which i feel will help her because she lights to play without the overhead lights on and the led lighting on the keyboard really helps you see the keyboard in the dark   i had recorded a video of the mouse color patterns too but it seems we can only upload one video per review      
2,5.0,                       it has been   months and i can t say much about how good the mouse is because my husband only used it for a couple of months and didn t like the feel of it so he got a new one   it worked good but while playing cod he hit the side left button by mistake too often   he loves the keyboard and it is still working great but the w paint has rubbed off because that s his run button   it still works perfect but we are remodeling our house  he built a new desk and he got a new keyboard same one but without the mouse    he will use this one as a back up      
3,5.0,                       so i recently switched to pc from ps  for gaming  i play fps  in particular warzone i used to play on keyboard back on counterstrike     days    so it s been a while  the keys are very responsive  it only has one pattern of rgb but it can go bright or dimmer with breathing pattern options i can t say it is all coincidental  but i went from   win every other day to getting like   wins a day in warzone  the mouse quick change in dpi really helps with steadying snipes or snapping turns to     an opponent that catches you off guard      
4,1.0,                       i have been a pc professional  since        was director of technology for  liusky int  magitronic  vp of engineering for channel communications and  vp of technology for harman kardon and i have no clue any anything but junk one can  call this piece of garbage  anything but junk  yes it is dirt cheap  but at any price this is junk and the people  loving  this are not qualified to judgefirst  the  lights have three  levedark  less dark and slightly lesser dark  but they are not  bright at all someone kidded themselves into calling it   mechanical nope it is  not mechanical it is membrane  and bad one there is no  click  and it overheats very fastas i said junk      
5,4.0,                       for the price  i d call it a decent keyboard  but it doesn t appear to have any macro capability  which in my own book leaves it unfit for a gaming keyboard   i always need that one  click at top speed  macro for the games that insist on rapid clicking for normal play   still  the keyboard has the pretty lights  buttons to control pc volume  and the keys are quiet  no clicky noises    the extended front looks like it s trying to function as a wrist rest  which i personally feel falls short of the mark in the worst possible way    but it s probably a  your mileage may vary  thing   some people may well like the extended front  but that very feature may force me to replace it with a keyboard that i can use a proper wrist rest with oh right  it ships with a mouse too   it s no trackball so i ve stashed it in a drawer for the fateful day my regular mouse breaks    lets give that a quick look   snazzy art design       decently bright light if i plug it in     the mouse wheel does not support left right motions  but most people don t use that mousewheel function even when it s present    and the blinking the mouse doeswhen i change dpi settings would be an issue in an unlit room  epileptic seizures being things that like triggering from blinking lights     half the point of having a glowing keyboard mouse being to use them in an unlit room  i could see that actually being a problem for some users   but the combo mouse keyboard still looks snazzy  and for some it s the looks that matter      
6,2.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          the kb has good action and fairly standard placement of keys  though i often hit the volume down key when i mean to press ctrl you will notice   things from the picture  the keys wear out from natural oils on the skin  food oils  and frictions   there should be some protective coating the caps lock is missing   i always remove caps  lock because it is annoying that it activates so easily   it should be a multi key toggle or a real switch   the insert  overwrite mode can also easily ruin a writing session   but these are problems endemic to all keyboards  pardon my rant turn the lights off  put stickers on the keys and it s a decent kb though the lighting is bright enough  but these tired old eyes could use larger symbolsthe sequencing has a few presets and adjustments for timing and brightness i have an older letton which looks exactly the same  with more worn out letters  that has a more pleasant sequencing for the kb and mouse wouldn t it be great if there were a cross platform python interface to control the lighting sequence another triviality  but fun      
7,2.0,                       first and foremost  they changed the design  most of the reviews you see here that are positive are older reviews from       when they had an actually good design  so  please disregard any review that came from before       as they are not talking about the same mouse and keyboard you potentially will be buying that said  onto the new design review the mouse lod  lift off distance  is rather high  which means if you lift your mouse off the mousepad at all  it ll still keep detecting movement even if you re half an inch off the pad  this can be extremely inconvenient as it will mess up your movement  the newer mouse design is a bit heavier then the previous design  but not too bad  its shape is mediocre  but acceptable too  its biggest flaw however  is definitely the lod which can inhibit movement during gameplay so be aware of that  perhaps it could be fixed with a little tape  but i m not terribly sure  as is however  sensitivity of the sensor is way too strong as for the keyboard  the design is also mediocre  its a pretty standard keyboard design  which generally is passable but nothing great  unfortunately  within a minute or two of typing and gameplay  my wrist started hurting and i m unsure if it was was from the mouse or the keyboard  i m actually inclined to think keyboard  but either the mouse or the keyboard had a design that wasn t super great for comfort wrist health  in addition to that  the new keyboard design lacked some keys from the previous design  which essentially played the role of the fn keys  and although the feature is now in the fn keys  it is not nearly as convenient or efficient as having the keys separate havit  if you re not going to go back to the old design  would you potentially consider making a separate page for the old design  i know i certainly would buy a brand new set of the old model if you were to sell it  as it was quite good and was a different design wise then other keyboards i have come across  including your newest design  or perhaps consider making a new design that incorporates more of the old designs   for both the keyboard and mouse  both were quite good  to customers  i am intending to ship back the set of the      version  and maybe the set will work better for you  but it doesn t quite work for me  if you do decide to buy it however  hope it works         
8,3.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          the keyboard is super light feels cheap  as seen in the video  bumping the keyboard hits certain keys unintentionally  non adjustable rgb lighting  only dimming options  bought this for my ex while on deployment  decided to give it a shot now since i m back and cleaning out all of my old stuff  it s not worth it  you can get a steel series keyboard at walmart for roughly the same price with more durability      
9,3.0,                       hi i bought this product about   months ago and when i was playing with it i heard a click  i didn t think much of it but when i got back on i saw that i couldn t use the left mouse button wasn t working correctly  when playing certain games reaction time and response is key but it would have a big delay to respond and made me lose a lot but i thought it was just the game until i tried other games  the same thing happened to me and i would have a large noticeable delay for everything  then i tried to use a office mouse that is not meant for gaming    but that was completely fine and it worked well  then i realized that the mouse button had broke  so i was wondering if we could have a replacement if not a refund or if it has a manufactures warranty      
10,4.0,                       overall      i loved the keyboard and the mouse  but there is   major issue i have found so far consthe first one  the biggest issue for me haha  is the position of the keys in the keyboard  the usual keyboards has from the esc to the ctrl key as the first keys from left to right in the keyboard  but this one has new column in there with the controls for the music  making you to  learn  again how to get used to the keyboard   and that s really stressing for me  as all the keyboards i ve used so far have the esc ctrl column as the first one  but well the pictures from the post show you how the keyboard is  but well i didn t paid attention to it  so it s my fault pros   super soft and comfortable touch for membrane keys  comes with multimedia keys  pause play  backward forward  volume up down    the spacebar is bigger than normal which is great for gaming and for typing  you have the option to adjust the height with two settings  the mouse feels great in my hand     
11,1.0,                       update  before i start i want to say that some of my original review still holds true  however  after using this keyboard for almost a month i can t recommend it anymore first of all  the mouse has turned out to be complete garbage and i found myself purchasing a different mouse which means the mouse that comes with this combo is a waste of space  second  i thought i could get used to the media keys being on the left side of the keyboard but man was i wrong  even after almost a months worth of use i still hit them on accident and end up changing a song i liked half way through  third  the backlighting has already started to become significantly dimmer and barely works anymore  especially on keys that are shades of purple or red  lastly  and my biggest complaint is the keyboard is that it doesn t have a dedicated mute button which at first i thought was alright but when i need to hear something quickly turns out to be a gigantic inconvenience overall i am still very impressed by certain parts of this keyboard but again the mouse is useless and the practicality of it is just lacking too much to be worth the purchase at this point i was unsure about this keyboard and mouse at first because it was relatively cheap especially for a combo that included backlighting  after reading the reviews though i decided to give it a try since what s the worst that can happen when you order something that s prime  not only did the keyboard far exceed any and all expectations but the mouse is large  although a little light  and works really well one of the bigger complaints i had read about was the fact that the lettering on the keys wasn t transparent so the backlighting didn t show through the keys  i personally was fine with this but when i received the keyboard to my pleasant surprise the lettering was transparent and after watching some older youtube videos on the keyboard it looks like they improved their design and made the keys transparent another complaint people have is the fact that the media keys are located on the left of the keyboard  while i do agree that it takes some getting used to i can see why it was done this way  it makes it so when your fingers are on wasd you can easily have access to these keys  for some people they may find it annoying but i think it really depends on personal preference and how much music you listen to while gaming  those who listen to a lot of music will love this keyboard even more there were a couple pleasant surprises when i got this keyboard that i just wasn t expecting from such an affordable keyboard that i just had to share  first of all  the feet on the bottom that allow the keyboard to be angled up or down include two separate feet allowing more than just two angles to the keyboard  second  i was expecting that the backlighting wasn t going to have any special features because that kind of thing is relatively expensive but it actually has a few modes  though nothing fancy   lastly  as some of the reviews mentioned it doesn t have a mute button  however  on my model it has one  fn f   the only problem with this is that it s a function key so it makes it a little difficult to mute things while playing overall there s things that could be improved upon but for the most part they ve made a quality item at a very good price  it includes more than you think it would and gives your setup a more custom look without having to break the bank      
12,1.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          really enjoyed this  even had compliments  but now   my let s are wearing away   and my lights sometimes doesn t work   also my mouse light quite working  not happy about it  i would like a refund    this keyboard was purchased sept     i bought it as a birthday present for myself   today is dec   th    it started wearing away a few weeks ago   i expected it to be better made      
13,1.0,                       ugghhh   nd time writing this review  i just wrote a whole bunch of stuff  mis keyed something and the keyboard took me out of this review  no i am having to re type this  i took off more stars  i am now fed up with this keyboard   let me try again  i bought this because the keyboard i had for years stopped working and i wanted one where i could see the keys in a darkened room  the price was right  i didn t want to spend        or more for a keyboard  you would think that a keyboard with all these garish lights  you would be able to change it to a dim  plain white light  apparently not  after plugging in the keyboard and looking for a way to get a solid white light or at least a single color  i opened the instruction manual and looked through all   pages off relevant information  i didn t need the mouse info  no multiple languages  i looked for a driver  software disc there is not one included in the box  i looked for a download on the mfg website  nothing  i looked over the manual again to see if i missed something  i didn t but there are a lot of things that are left unexplained   they mention something about  lasting mode  but do not explain what that means  the same with  breathing mode  what the heck is that supposed to mean  it also says  wasd can be exchanged with  up arrow  down arrow  left and right arrow    what does  wasd  mean  what is the purpose of exchanging it with arrows and why would you want to do that  then it mentions    antighosting keys  what are ghosting keys  what are anti ghosting keys  what is ghosting anyway  why is this mentioned but not explained  also  on the keyboard itself  the keys that have multiple characters  they are side by side on the key cap instead of up and down so you have to constantly guess which character is normal and which is shifted  also they tops of the keys are too far above the keyboard making it difficult to touch type without hitting multiple keys  you also have to look at the keys that you are typing so your fingers don t hit two keys at once  usually side by side  you have to use a bit more force to depress the keys and this makes for a louder keyboard  it is not very easy to use  i used the keyboard for a week  my productivity went down  my error rate went up  it s been mentioned that i should type quieter  also  so many comments of  where did you get that ugly keyboard   yeah  this thing is going back  i ll try to find a normal logitech keyboard that has a solid white light  this one has too many flaws      
14,1.0,                       only good thing about this keyboard is that it looks really awesome  design level i will say is on point however  get a different keyboard and probably a different brand i ve been experiencing progressively worst disconnection on both my mouse and keyboard  it started with the mouse and was occasional and they keyboard at this point is almost non usable  have been using it for a little over a month the mouse will also occasionally turn on despite the computer being off if you have a cat that likes to bap at things the colors are set on the keyboard and the mouse changes on it s own  you can t change the colors yourself overall  it fails at it s basic functionality there is no phone number you can contact you can only submit a form or email will update if they are responsive to that      
15,4.0,                       i used this for months  so far it s great but i am not a gamer  as a student  writing papers at night the rgb helped a ton  i like the option to turn off the lights in the mouse  which get distracting   it s not ergonomic though  the numeric pad got in my way so i had to change keybards  but it s a great tool and was very dependable  note  i found the keys to be a little too far apart causing me to type slower than with my logitech  i assume it s because it does feel more masculine  made for bigger fingers and hands      
16,1.0,                       this keyboard worked great for three months and the wires crapped out and the keyboard won t work with out lucky juggling the wires and hoping the keyboard turns on  usually it won t or wont stay on long  in   months this keyboard died  amazon won t allow a return  the company manufacturer won t respond  i m out of money on this trash i don t recommend this  at all      
17,3.0,                       first off  i see     marked on the box    i paid more than     percent more than that  it s a keyboard that lights up  it looks cool but you cannot change colours  the brightest setting is still quite dim and there s keys that are not readable due to the black paint on the key through the backlight  if your looking for a more affordable backlog keyboard with multi colours than this will do  i m returning this product and looking for something of better quality      
18,5.0,                       my first keyboard  a logitech gaming keyboard  broke so i had to find a replacement  i m glad to say that this set is much better than i expected  the keyboard backlights are beautiful and i love how ergonomic and accurate the mouse is  but wait  there s more  the keyboard is waterproof    you can literally dip it in a water bucket after drenching it during an intense gaming session  in addition  the mechanical keys feel expensive and they don t clack as loud as other ones i ve used  it has a very fast response time and it allows me to consistently type at      wpm  overall  i would highly recommend this great value keyboard set  and i ll definitely be buying a few more for my friends in the near future      
19,2.0,                       i bought this a few months ago  originally for use with my raspberry pi  since then i have built a new pc  and have been using this set full time the last   months so figured it would be best to write a review here is the quick summary  this keyboard looks great  but i cannot recommend that anyone buy it as the keyboard and mouse frequently lock up during usage  making it unreliablepros  why i gave this   stars instead of     looks great  the keyboard has a nice multi colour hue across the keys that looks really slick  the mouse slowly fades between a handful of colours as well  overall  the entire set  looks  like a gaming keyboard and mouse  the keyboard feels nice to type on  makes a very satisfying click when typing cons  too many dpi options for the mouse  i find myself accidentally clicking the button on the mouse and changing dpi  the only indication you have which dpi your mouse is  is based on the colour it flashes  which is tough to remember when playing an fps and you accidentally change dpi  and then need to cycle through the different options to figure out which one is right  the main con  this keyboard mouse must have some severe power issues our something  as both periodically drop loss connection lock up freeze no matter which device i am using or what i am working on  for example  typing an email and all of a sudden a key will get lock   how are you doing todddddddddddddddddday     not hyperbole   the mouse will become complete unresponsive  mid round  all of a sudden i cannot move the pointer at all  after about   seconds it suddenly comes back  happens several times a day  plugged into my pc  work laptop  and person laptop  same thing everywhere   this makes the entire set unreliable and unusable  without this issue  i d be totally happy with this set  now  i am shopping for a new one      
20,4.0,                       for a        keyboard mouse set  this is a really good product  i was impressed pulling it out of the box because it s pretty sturdy and solid  with four settings on the keyboard lighting system i originally thought to leave it off but now i keep it fully lit because it doesn t light up the room nor cause any glares  though with the lights off in a low lit room  the letters on the keys are not easy to see  the mouse has only two options on it s lighting system  pulsing between all colours or off    i just leave it off because i don t need to watch my mouse  upon arrival  the mouse s left button was raised by about half a centimeter against it s case but once i pulled it out and pressed it back in it s place it was fine  that did not cause any defects one thing i don t like about the keyboard are the media buttons being on the left side of the keyboard with full sized buttons  i tend to hit the volume down button while i m playing a game and turn off the volume when i mean to hit ctrl  the only reason i need to look down on my keyboard is to hit ctrl  shift and tab  hopefully i ll get used to this in time above all  this product is really good and well worth it  yes i would recommend this      
21,4.0,                       the product is basically as advertised and i haven t had any problems with functionality at all  the keys are a little bit bigger than i am used to so i am adapting to them but not completely loving them  it seems like both the size of the keys and the spacing of them causes me to miss buttons or accidentally hit wrong keys sometimes  but i figure that s more of a personal adjustment than a problem  just keep in mind while shopping  i don t find it very ergonomic for that reason  i like the rainbow lights  but of course definitely note that you cannot change it to one static color like green or white or whatever  i actually really wish you could just turn it to white because i wear really thick glasses and colors in my peripherals can sometimes split and become distracting  and that happens a littlei am still adapting to the size and placement  as i mentioned  it s just worth noting in case you re like me and would find that a little frustrating      
22,5.0,                       i m happy with my new keyboard  this was my first time actually buying a fancy keyboard so my opinion might not mean as much  however  i m very happy with it for the price as far as the keys go  i think they feel pretty nice  i m not used to my space bar having a such spring load it it  but i m trying to get used to it  again  i m not an expert so someone else may feel differently i like the feeling of the mouse as well  the mouse has the typical left click  right click and scroll in addition to a button on top to control the light and two buttons on the left side  the buttons on the left side by default are back and forward buttons  i think they can be programmed but i haven t tested  the keyboard lights can be turned on and off with the light bulb button and the lights on the mouse can be controlled with the center  button underneath the scroll   the button basically allows you to switch and have the eagle be purple  light blue  dark blue  yellow red or green  i personally like how the lights on the bottom of the mouse transitions  i wish the keyboard could do that        
23,3.0,                       first off  this keyboard is really good for gaming  the mechanical keys feel really good and give excellent feedback  the led backlighting is both non essential and ultra cool  my one problem   and it is a huge one   is the location of the backslash pipe key and the enter key  look closely at the screenshots  and you ll see that the backslash key is where the long part of the enter key is on most keyboards   you have no idea how many times i ve accidentally hit enter when i meant to type either a backslash or pipe  over and over and over  i can t get over the muscle memory i have for where that backslash should be  having part of the enter key there is friggin frustrating        
24,5.0,                       i liked this keyboard and mouse combo so much i ordered another for my home office and one for my wife  who also loves it   the mechanical feel is very satisfying for someone that has to do a lot of typing throughout the day and the mouse is one of the best i have ever used   i ordered this to replace the keyboard in my home office that can get very dark from time to time  usually at night    some reviewer had mentioned that the keys themselves do not light up  just space in between the keys   that is only partially true   in a dark environment  the letters and number do light up  at least enough so that you can read them   overall i am glad i switched from my wireless set to this one      
25,2.0,                       keyboard lights are very dim on edge keys  mouse freezes during gameplay i missed the part of the description that discloses that the keys are not individually back lit and was disappointed to see that the lights are solid static and will not cycle through colors  it is all based on a central back light which causes the keys furthest from the center to be very dim  even in a dark room i could not easily see the         keys  or the qwert keys  most used during games  the mouse  on the other hand  is very bright and the dpi control works very well  however the thing froze often while playing wow or guild wars also  the enter key is strange  it stretches vertically instead of horizontally like most keyboards  so i would often find myself hitting the     key rather than enter which was very annoying when trying to type quick messages in game if you want dynamic  bright lighting on a keyboard and a mouse that does not freeze  put the   towards slightly more expensive items      
26,1.0,                       bought this to go with my newly built computer  keyboard was fine for about   months and now all of the sudden i have keys doing weird things  i ll press the   key and it types     i press the v key and it acts as though the return key was pressed and vice versa for the return key  not certain what to think since the keyboard is roughly   months old        an update to my previous review  i have now taken it down to one star  after again barely having this keyboard for  months  the previous issues were resolved with gently  burping  the board  but now after a few weeks  the left shift key and the return key do not register when pressed  piece of junk  do not buy      
27,2.0,                       i bought this a few weeks ago looking to upgrade my logitech keyboard  since then i ve returned this keyboard and got a mechanical one for the same price as this instead  and it s so much better  when i bought this one  shipping didn t take long  but they sent me the wrong layout  it looked like what appeared to be a uk layout  i think   meanwhile in the pictures it was in the us layout  although it didn t matter too much  the small shift key and narrow enter key were enough to annoy me while using it  i tried messaging the support email included in a little piece of paper that came in the box  and even after a few days  they never replied  they keyboard itself was okay  it isn t a mechanical keyboard if you were wondering   it was a little mushy to type on however and the multimedia keys got very annoying as whenever i tried to press control or shift or whatever  i accidentally pressed one of the multimedia keys instead  which was happening constantly  it felt somewhat decent to type on  however like i have said before  mechanical keyboards are a lot better and you can possibly find one for the same price as this one  maybe even a little cheaper  it was made mostly out of plastic  which was expected  and didn t break while i was using it  so build quality was good  althought  the mouse on the other hand    the mouse  while it looked really cool with the lighting  was not that great  it has some sharp points in some spots  especially near the front  the material feels kind of rubbery but it isn t and doesn t feel too great to hold  mine seemed to be extremely sensitive as well  because when i tried to use it on my desk  the cursor started going bonkers  so i had to get a cheap mousepad in order for it to stop  after that i had no more sensitivity issues  but the mouse still felt cheap compared to the keyboard  the returning process went okay  but i m very glad i returned it as i found something much better for the same price  if you re on an extreme budget  then maybe consider buying this  but there are better options out there for the same price  or even less than the price of this made by better companies that are more trustworthy and will reply to emails you send to them   unlike this one      
28,4.0,                       i haven t physically used this yet as my desktop hasn t arrived yet  but i will say that it looks beautiful and i m assuming they work fine  the keys feel nice and the mouse is a good fit for my hand my only issue is that the way this was shipped was awful  one small piece of tape  a crushed box  and the side of the box was open with the keyboard wire dangling in the next couple weeks i ll be testing them out and i m hoping the damage from shipping hasn t broken them in some way      
29,1.0,                       the keyboard died a month after purchase  i have reached out to the manufacturer about warranty coverage and i have not heard anything back  i have even purchased the   year extended warranty  but that doesn t go into effect until the manufacturer warranty expires  i will continue to try and reach the manufacturer for a resolution and will update this post if they do      
30,5.0,                       ever since i started working from home i ve had a desire to personalize my computer station  to make it feel more like my own and less like a piece of the office sitting in my corner  this keyboard was great for that  it honestly brightens my day to sit down and type on the lit up keys  the mouse is excellent too  although it took some getting used to as it was much quicker and more responsive than the previous office mouse i was using      
31,1.0,                       i was heavily dissatisfied with my purchased of this keyboard and mouse combo to the point where i had to request a refund  my main issues revolve around the keyboard itself  when the keyboard was sent over it worked perfectly fine  but after a good     days issues came up with its buggy keys  ever so often  pressing certain keys would also press another key that was not in its immediate area   for example pressing the h key would have pressed the   key as well  and pressing left shift would have muted the entire computer  the mouse was also dissatisfying  as the left click is not fully responsive  pressing it repeatedly would not register every click  leaving to many failures when gaming  which is disheartening since its marketed toward this market all in all  do not buy this      
32,5.0,                       when i start to fee a migraine coming on  i can shut off the room lights and just see by keyboard mouse light and it works great for me      
33,3.0,                       everything is seemingly working the what it should except for the fact that the keyboard refuses to change the volume no matter what  it changes brightness due to a shortcut i placed on it so it doesn t even use the preset brightness keys   overall it s pretty to look at but not sure how practical it is update  caps lock indicator light has gone out after one day of being used        
34,4.0,                       i bought this for my kid during this  shelter in place  time and he loves it   i tried it and it feels a little cheap but it does do the job   he doesn t know the difference between what a really good keyboard feels like versus a bad one so he can t say what is bad   he only knows it works   the mouse is overly sensitive and even with some tweaking  it s still super sensitive   the is no way to control the color changing on the mouse to remain one color   it just cycles through all the colors   i wish there was a way to assign colors to chosen keys but you can t   all in all  a decent keyboard for the price      
35,4.0,                       edit  it s been a couple minutes since i posted my original review  and the keyboard and mouse seem to be working again after restarting my computer  however  my keyboard and mouse have never acted up prior to purchasing the havit keyboard and mouse set  hopefully  this issue won t re emerge  i ve still gone ahead and purchased an alternate mouse and keyboard because something about this one rubs me the wrong way   regardless  the keyboard and mouse look great  i have no idea what s up with the hardware though  i d still recommend doing some research to find a reliable keyboard  i have a feeling this won t last me much longer original review  i m not one to write a poor review for a product and believe me  i really wanted to like this keyboard and mouse combo   but it was just too good to be true  when i first received the package and set up the mouse and keyboard  everything worked perfectly  the keys were comfortable  the mouse felt decent  i was pleased  now     days later  so just about a month  and everything still feels great  but the keys have become unresponsive as well as the mouse  i ve seen others have issues with this and i m sad to say that it is no different for me  the key bindings have randomly switched up as well as the bindings for the mouse miraculously so i legitimately am unable to work  i ve tried updating the keyboard and mouse drivers  unplugging them and plugging them back in  restarting my computer  but nothing is working  i ll be looking into purchasing a more expensive keyboard in the future  i d rather pay a hefty amount for a reliable keyboard than buy a cheap keyboard and mouse combo for them to break only a month later if it looks too good to be true  it usually is  i d advice not wasting any money on this  it s better to just fork over     or so for a reliable  sturdy keyboard that ll actually last a couple years      
36,1.0,                       trying to return  the product photo is not what  you get  maybe in a completely dark room  in regular lighting you can barely see the colored backlights even at highest setting which is why i bought this in the first place   if you stand directly over top of board you can see the lighting a little better  however i usually sit when typing   the keys are nice and have a good feel  that slightly rubbery texture as opposed to hard plastic      
37,4.0,                       i managed to snag this as one of the daily deals  arrived on time in an overly sized box which i found quite amusing  had no problems setting up as they were connected via usb  and worked as intended  the only gripe that i d have with this keyboard is that the keys aren t in the same place as a standard keyboard  so getting used to where stuff is can be quite cumbersome  overall  the quality of the unit is nice  and the glow effect is cool in the dark  definitely buy if it manages to shows up on the daily deals again      
38,1.0,                       if you re a wasd gamer playing games like destiny    dying light or immortals go with a different keyboard because after a week or two you will find the fatal flaw of this item  it s the space bar  it has a flattened edge to allow you to work it easier but after a little use it wears the buttons inside and jams up  in most of these games space bars are typically for jumping right  and in these types of games  jumping keeps you alive so you do it constantly   look at the space bar picture and see the shiny spot near the top  if you re a gamer that s where your thumb is forever   this causes the internal buttons under the space bar to get a lot more wear and tear because the space bar is no longer being pushed straight down but at an angle  those buttons wear faster and the space bar starts jamming up and sticking  the manufacturer did not do any extensive product testing here  it becomes very apparent in a few weeks of playing  its a    dollar keyboard so expect that  the mouse is very cool and seems to work fine  but the keyboard one and only flaw is a major one for gamers  suppose to be a keyboard made for gamers    nope  spend more   get better revised  keyboard is dead  gone back to old logitech which seems to never fail  several keys on this  magic eagle  no longer work at all    tab  n  alt and a few more quit  hope you have better luck than me      
39,2.0,                       you re getting what you pay for  it s not a high end quality keyboard or mouse  the mouse feels pretty okay an odd texture but you get used to it  the keyboard however is a disappointing part though i do like the layout it is beyond noisy  it s louder than my      keyboard and the cap locks occasionally tends to turn on or acts as if it s on even when it s not  in all honesty opinion your best bet is just buying the mouse separately and i m getting a cheaper or more quieter keyboard unless you will like the sound of constant thumping every time you hit the spacebar update  literally a hour later  the spacebar seems to either have busted itself or was prebroken  dropping this from a   star to a       
40,4.0,                       i personally wouldn t have purchased this for myself   sure the backlit keys and light up mouse look cool  but the mouse is kind of bulky for gaming  however the keyboard is decent  and is the strongest part of this combo but  i didn t buy this for myself  i got it for my   year old so he feels cool playing fortnite and roblox   he loves these  and so do all his friends   for a fraction of the cost of any razer or steelseries products  my kid has a cool looking keyboard and mouse combo that he loves      
41,5.0,                       i bought this keyboard   years ago as a place holder when i first built my pc and its still going strong  all the lights and keys still work the same as day one despite me beating it every time i die in a game and get trashed talked for it  which is what inspired me to write this review the only drawbacks are that it can put your wrist at weird angle depending on your setup so i would recommend a support for your wrist if you play long hours at a time  and the keyboard cord is at least a foot shorter than the one for the mouse  which is only really a problem if you have a weird setup like myself  also a little nit picky but the lights turn off after a few minutes of non use  which is fine  but when it s dark and you don t know key placements cause i didn t take typing class seriously it s just an inconvenience when you start typing  that might be a setting  but i don t read instructions and regarding the mouse  it too has stood up rather well aside from within the past year the wheel will sometimes scroll opposite if my dpi is high enough  but overall a solid starter or casual kit      
42,5.0,                       we purchased these last year for both the teen and the tween  they use these all day long for school and gaming  the keyboards look just as pictured i can t say if they are ergonomic or not  but my boys use these all day and haven t complained about any discomfort no issues over a year later  definitely a good purchase      
43,4.0,                       so the keys are not very bright  yes i have it set to the max  it s the rainbow that throws me off  i took it to mean it could do a rainbow any color  not of all the colors at once   the mouse seems to work ok   there seems to be a large disportportional amount play in the senseativty on the mouse   the keystrokes feel solid  but don t expect to beat on it  the keyboard needs more stiffining it flexs  and with as large as it is   the amount of shear force one can apply is cause for concern  as it s a gaming combo bumbs and bruises go with the game  for which it should stick to flag football   for those with palm issues the mouse works well  at least it s of good size your hand doesn t drag  i have big hands with long fingers  combo is good for tall or big men just don t beat the keyboard      
44,2.0,                       for the price  its a solid built product  it looks nice and the quality isnt bad  the reason i did not give a lower rating is because their customer support did a great job in helping me resolve an issue i had with a mouse i previously purchased  although i cannot give them a higher rating because they completely ignored me when i reached out about the keyboard  i think mine may have come defective  because i ve had another keyboard of the same brand for almost a year now  with no issues  i believe this keyboard is defective because whenever i type  it either does not register  or it registers more than one keystroke  for example  if i wanted to type the number one hundred  and the zero decides to act up  it either comes out as     or            this happens across all the keys and at random  perhaps the membrane underneath the keys is the culprit  either way  when i reached out to customer support  i was ignored  its been a week since i reached out  and still no answer  so unfortunately  i will be returning this product      
45,4.0,                       probably one of the loudest keyboard  i can hear the clicking and clacking of the keyboard from the other room  my son like playing games but hearing the constance click and clacking as he playing will drive any parent crazy  although this works great and look great  i can not give it a   star for that reason  need to redesign it  had to buy him an apple keyboard for when he plays at night it doesn t drive me crazy  good luck parents      
46,3.0,                       i have had this keyboard and mouse for a little over a week  and i would of rather bought something else  the keyboard lights do not change rainbow  the only options are for a brighter light  darker light  and flashing light and even this does not work  i would of thought it is an overall changing light but it stays the same colors in the pictures  there is squeaking keys as well including the space key and i can not tell you how annoying this is  the space is the most used key and to hear it squeak every time is frustrating so for the keyboard the lights are broken and it has squeaking keys  if it wasn t for this i would love the keyboard because it works so nicely and is huge for the price my only problem with the mouse is that the side buttons seem way to big and it feels like it takes up half the space  i am always accidentally pressing either of the two buttons for the price i am not disappointing but if you have the money i highly suggest buying a different product      
47,4.0,                       i used these products for about   months until a bit of moisture got in the keyboard and one of the keys started phantom pressing   once the  g  starts spamming whenever you type something  it gets to be unusable   overall  i had a great experience with it prior to this happening  so i m keeping the stars lofty   the keyboard itself feels moderately durable  heavier than your standard cheap keyboard which is nice   the keys are also slightly heavier than a standard keyboard  which lends well to gaming   when the keyboard is not in use for a while  it goes to  sleep  and turns off all of the rgb backlighting  which in some cases makes it hard to see keys when coming back   all said  it was a good keyboard while it was still working properly the mouse is also your standard low cost gaming mouse   it has additional buttons near the thumb rest  which for some reason i couldn t ever seem to get to program in any decent way  but didn t try too hard    there didn t seem to be a software package to aid in the mouse configuration  but again it has been a while since i used these  after the keyboard quit  so did i  all said and done  you get what you pay for   this is a decent keyboard mouse pair for the nonchalant gamer   if you want true customization  you may want to throw some more money at something else  probably not in a package deal with keyboard mouse   but if a quick and easy gaming setup is all you desire  this is a great product      
48,2.0,                       in the few weeks that i ve had the havit keyboard and gaming mouse i ve found that the keyboard is great but the mouse is terrible   i researched and bought havit because of customer reviews   and the fact that i needed a gaming mouse   despite making every adjustment possible  i can t improve the performance   this mouse is far short of a gaming mouse   everyday basic use functions such as point and click or drag and drop are such a challenge as the pointer runs mindlessly across my screen   and let s not even talk about gaming   can t tell you how many times i ve died because my mouse starts spinning and pointing to the sky or ground   not the best when you re in a firefight  i am so disappointed that i spent a bit more money thinking that i was getting a superior product   this mouse is garbage and not usable      
49,1.0,                       it is a bad cheap keyboard   not comforable to use and the keys bounces back so hard and so badly  you can tell it is made with cheap material and keys positions are not very good as ordinary keyboards we used to have   i could reach     words per min with my old keyboard easily   i can probably do    word per min with this creepy one   i should have returned this keyboard this keyboard should sell for      for its bad future   we paid    extra for its fancy lights that is not worth it i highly recommend to buy another keyboard instead this one   it is just not worth    bucks      
50,5.0,                       this gaming keyboard works pretty well with most modern day games with little input lag  the keyboard and mouse fit comfortably in my hands and the tactile feel of the mouse and keyboard feels great  the mouse of very responsive with no drift the lighting in the keyboard is a bit soft but that s ok as it doesn t blind you when typing in the dark the build quality is good and it s a sturdy keyboard  i d recommend it to anyone looking for an entry level gaming keyboard and mouse      
51,5.0,                       first off  this is not a mechanical keyboard  it is however  a membrane keyboard  if you don t know the difference  basically this feels like a normal laptop keyboard while a high quality gaming keyboard will have mechanical buttons that feel and sound very differently  it s also important to note that the lights on this keyboard are set  and cannot be configured or changed  that being said  for the price and what it offers  it is worth the purchase as long as you have done your homework and know what you are looking for  personally  i really like this one  it appears to be good quality and i haven t had any issues yet      
52,5.0,                       oh man i love this thing so much    they were very easy to install  just plug and play  everything worked and lit up immediately  i got a little worried the second day when the backlights on the keyboard didn t come on  but then i realized that there s a button for that   doh   programming the lights was extremely easy and the keyboard is comfortable to type on  nothing to complain about here      
53,2.0,                       i like the kb it self and the last kb i bought same brand it was much better with the paint on the keys after about a year of using this kb the paint has been coming off the keys unlike the other havit wired kb this one i would not recommend the paint and the letters on the keys i cant see them its great for cheap gaming kb but there older version kb paint was way durable     
54,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          the keyboard and mouse are both usb so they connect to your computer  that s where they receive they re power source for the lights  people seem to think they re wireless  they are not  after a few hours of gaming left hand hurts so you have to adjust your hand just right on the plastic under the keyboard  keyboard has   settings  first is off no lights  then you press fn   escape and it turn ons  third setting is the same as the second one but little bit more bright  and lastly the final option is for the keyboard to turn on and off by its self   note  the colors are presets so you cant change them  from left to right it goes blue  purple  red  orange  yellow  and lastly green  mouse has   colors  white  red  green  purple  blue  and yellow   yellow is only available when you hold the button for roughly   seconds  until it turns on   when the mouse is off you can press the button  located below the slider for viewing web pages up and down  this turns it on and if you keep pressing it  it changes color  but turns off after a few seconds  if you hold the button about     seconds it will turn on and switch colors on it s on  which varies from light colors listed above  and the same colors but darker      
55,1.0,                       this keyboard is fine  except that an extra key has been placed between the     key and the enter or return key   i find it annoying to have to re learn how far to move to hit the enter key   i am continually hitting the     key that has been inserted   because i cannot reach the enter return key easily   i actually use the enter key a lot   so this is really problematic  bordering on making the keyboard completely useless  and a waste of money i guess that i should have checked the keyboard layout closely to see the differences   i d suggest buying a different keyboard i haven t tried the mouse yet      
56,3.0,                       i bought this keyboard april of       about a month ago i started having typing issues where it would not read my input of keys and either skipped letters or lagged the input  so today i dug out an old hp keyboard that hadn t been used in almost   years and before that was used for a few years  it still works perfectly fine  dusty and all  it sort of discourages me from buying any more products from this company even though  as far as i am aware  the mouse is still in working order the keyboard from this set still lights up  but the caps lock and num lock lights do not light up and no key registers input any more  i def got my money s worth considering how it was prob only        at the time  but i def would not buy again and will use this old hp until i can afford something from corsair      
57,3.0,                       i just received this after purchasing it   i have to give it   stars because i hate the mouse and will not use it   it doesn t fit in my palm  it s too big   my fingers don t sit right on the side buttons  and as i intend to use it for gaming  that s a big problem   the keyboard is excellent for the price and i m quite happy with that portion of it   if you have larger hands  you probably wont have the issue with the mouse that i have  but my hands are fairly small   also  the mouse has different dpi settings  but they can t be changed   instead  it has four predefined settings you can change between   even without using the mouse  i recommend this purchase   the value of the keyboard alone makes it worth it   it feels great when i type on it  the keys have good resistance and it has a click  but not too loud      
58,1.0,                       the keyboard itself is actually quite up to par with others of it s caliber however  as i am typing this review  the spacebar is a bit too loud and the key switches just don t feel as satisfying as other ones  not to mention  this is my first macro key keyboard  the macro keys being on the left threw me off as what i thought i was pressing was shift but turned out to be volume  the led display is quite nice with the rainbow colors for all you rgb enthusiasts  but that mouse    holy crap  switched my old one back because of that deceiving thing  the side buttons are placed appropriately but my hand kept sliding off because of how unnecessarily beefy the left and right mouse buttons are  so if you got small to average hand sizes like mine  you will get a terrible mouse experience  it s a fine product  but i can t help but feel that i could ve gotten better for the same price elsewhere update  after around   months of use    it breaks  no longer usable by my computer  oh yeah the mouse still sucks      
59,5.0,                       this set of mouse and keyboard does exactly what it s supposed to do granted  i don t do much gaming  but i did want a backlit keyboard for various reasons  and this delivers  the keyboard has crisp key presses  and the mouse is very precise  both are well illuminated  and the keyboard has multiple colors for the key illumination  i generally choose green because it s the best mix of brightness and clarity  certain lights on the keyboard will always be blue  though  even when key backlighting is turned off    not a problem for me  but some users might need to be aware best of all  the price was right  if you want a good keyboard at a good price  this is definitely worth a look so cool     
60,1.0,                       firstly  they say that you can change the light settings on the mouse but i never got it to change anything  there are no instructions on how to do anything   more importantly  the mouse stopped working within a week or so  i thought it worked great when it arrived but then it started to freeze up  i bought the mouse to play minecraft and it will get stuck in one position  plus it will act as if i am holding down the left click button  meaning that i can t move and can t stop what i am doing i have tried switching usb ports  leaving it unplugged  changing where the mouse it and using getting rid of a mousepad  at this point it is freezing up more and more frequently  probably every   minutes or less don t waste your money  it s a trap and is not worth the frustration i have not had any problems with the keyboard as of yet  but i have barely used it with a different computer      
61,5.0,                       it was a really good buy at        the week of black friday   it is still well price now that the price has gone back up  it is a well constructed keyboard and mouse and should last a few years   bought it to replace a dying keyboard for my   year old son  he absolutely loved it especially the fun colors on the keyboard and the mouse changing colors   it it has quick typing response on the keyboard keys and fast click response on the mouse   feel like i got a really good deal compared to the really high priced keyboards and mouse combos out there  ranging from        for the mouse and          on the keyboards while at the microsoft store i checked out the  razer blackwidow chroma mechanical gaming keyboard  for         without a mouse   keyboard layout was exactly the same except the havit board has   extra macro buttons on the top of the keyboard for home email computer   quality  feeling and look ere virtually the same between the boards with really no really differences even on key response  one difference  the havit board seems brighter on the display of colors that light up behind the keys   walked out of microsoft chuckling on what a good deal i got vs what microsoft is charging for basically the same board   i would buy this again even at a high price      
62,5.0,                       im very happy with this keyboard and mouse combo  the colorful lights are super cool and fun  the mouse is very smooth and easy to hold  the keyboard is very nice and the plastic is almost like a velvet its kinda strange description its just really nice  im very satisfied with this purchase and im glad i picked it  very good quality at a very reasonable price   definitely recommend this product      
63,5.0,                       works exactly how you d hope a keyboard and mouse would work  i m a big fan of the clicking noises that keyboards make  and this one has a nice click  it s a pretty good size  my only adjustment is that i keep hitting the   key instead of the enter key because the enter key is a little further from the j key than usual  and i have small hands that can t reach it without moving the rest of my fingers from their proper keys      
64,4.0,                       this keyboard is fairly comfortable to use  particularly while gaming   i  don t know if i would want it if i were a professional gamer  but i m an old man who is just having fun and it works well for me i have stopped needing to compose reports so i spend far less time typing and the keyboard does an adequate job for me all in all i think it s worth the money and effort to get used to using   i d buy it again under the same circumstances   hopefully  though  i won t have to and it will continue to serve me well      
65,5.0,                       bought this bundle as an alternative to other brands   did not feel like spending     on a keyboard and another     on a mouse   this is a great bundle that gives that look and feel of the more popular brands i feel the mouse is the strongest piece of the two   i love how it  breaths  colors   also  the mouse includes the dpi button feature  great when in the middle of a game   the feel of the mouse in my palm feels natural as well keyboard has been great as well   includes the keylock functions for windows key and alt tab the only thing i did not like at first was the placement of the enter key   shaped differently than other keyboards  but it is something you will learn to adapt to overall  great bundle   no real complaints      
66,5.0,                       i do a little gaming  but mostly day trading stocks  excel spreadsheets and programming i tried wireless keyboards and found issues with the keyboard communicating with my pc     i won t blame the keyboards  since it might be due to the wireless antenna i have on my pc or the newly installed nest devices and other smart devices in my home i wanted a low cost keyboard option  because i am frugal  and this one popped up after about a month of searching  so i pulled the trigger i love the ergonomics and the feel of the keys and mouse   everything functions great   sometimes it doesn t capitalize a letter  so not sure if it is operator error or the keyboard my only issue is with the symbols on the keys being hard to see   i had      vision about    years ago  now my eyes strain to see the       key on the keyboard   i plan on either swapping out the keys for white with black lettering or simply put stickers over the keys that i struggle with but that is it     for the price this is an incredible keyboard and mouse   if i find white replacement keys  then i will buy this keyboard again to have as a backup      
67,4.0,                       i got this keyboard after upgrading my desk from one layer to a top layer with a roller for the keyboard and mouse under the main desk section  i needed a smaller keyboard for this setup and didn t want to spend too much  so i went with this one as it was cheap and had good reviews  i ll focus my review more towards the keyboard rather than the mouse because the mouse was functionally normal for a gaming mouse and a good deal with the keyboard  moving on  the keyboard has great key and placement  it feels crisp when you get the key placement down and typing a few hundred words for an essay feels real good  its also nice to game on  with the ergonomic design of the media keys  with them just left of the wasd i loved the keyboard for about two months then the spacebar started sticking as a side effect of the extra tab on the spacebar  for easier reach i guess  the spacebar will eventually start sticking and stop being very useful  especially in games that require lots of jumping or other spacebar use all in all the price was good for what i got but now it s time for me to upgrade ps  still using the mouse  it is very good and smooth  including its quick access dpi changer     
68,2.0,                       the quality of this keyboard is fine  but the tops of the keys  i e  the part touched with fingers  is smaller than on standard keyboards  probably because the keys were made taller to allow room for lighting under the keys   this makes the keyboard more difficult to use  and more prone to making errors  in our experience   the nice lighting is not worth the loss in functionality  in our view   figuring out how to change colors is also very difficult      
69,5.0,                       i have stalked this keyboard and mouse combo for a year on amazon because i knew it was perfect for my nearly    year old son who games non stop on a large  touchscreen pc   we have purchased endless wireless keyboards  mouses  and headsets and i learned fast that when it comes to gaming    you can either waste tons of money on wireless only to get endless lag and complaints from your teens   or you can buy wired devices that are much faster and don t need replacement every six months i ended up paying        for this set because sadly    they ran low near black friday and cyber monday and my choice was  wait for it to go back to        and risk losing it entirely   or suck it up and pay more to make sure you get it    so i paid     and am still just as thrilled as the        i had planned to pay   they keyboard is large and finally i cannot hear him clicking away endlessly no matter where i am in the house   the colors are very vibrant and the mouse is really very high end with lots of options compared to higher priced models   my son didn t  want  a wired set because like all younger kids    they ve lived in a wireless world their entire lives   but since i did my research and bought a usb hub    he s thrilled to plug all of this in  plus i bought him wired and lighted headphones microphone awhile back that need   ports themselves  without actually losing   total ports he says the keyboard is speedier and much easier to use for gaming as well as in game chat   the colors are great for him and he likes the ability to switch modes on the mouse  as well as choosing  breathe  to fade colors in and out or to keep the mouse one color   he likes the dpi and anti ghosting options  but is still acclimating to when and where to use them for a christmas gift  this was perfect for my son because he s already been at the age for several years where he wants nothing but  steam gift cards  and gives me zero ideas of what to put under the tree   this was reasonably priced  exciting for him to open  it s the first thing he hooked up and even stopped opening gifts to do so   and actually seemed to be more of a thrill than the replacement hd tv i bought him for his bedroom  he was using a    year old tube tv    i personally love the look of it and the membrane keys are nearly silent compared to any style of keyboard   the keyboard has solid weight and wiring with no cheap attributes that make me fear it breaking after a few months for a teen that is hard to buy for and you aren t looking to spend      on a single gift    this was perfect   and although i d have loved to get the normal price of           i don t regret snatching it up for the        price one bit   he loves and i love it and i recommend it to anyone looking for a great gift to a gamer or just someone who loves awesome colors  speedy response  and a large nice layout   i absolutely recommend this set above others in the  under       price range   really a fantastic purchase     update january               i had a minor problem with the mouse  but the keyboard is functioning famously   i contacted the seller and unlike many transactions  the seller responded within the hour with a solution   they offered a replacement mouse that is  upgraded  without my needing to return the whole set  since i have no issue with the keyboard  and apologized for any problems with the mouse  which were minor   my son experienced the mouse  going off in all directions despite using directional keys  and as soon as i contacted the seller about the issue  he they immediately offered to send an upgraded mouse at no cost to me without the hassle of returning the mouse that isn t working properly   the response was lightening fast and despite only contacting the seller mere hours ago    they already responded  solved the problem  provided a code to purchase a replacement mouse  at no cost to me  and were clearly interested in my experience with the new mouse once it arrives   this is some of the fastest and most accurate  correction  of a minor problem i have had on amazon and this seller is clearly dedicated to excellence in both service as well as functionality   i m more than impressed as a regular amazon shopper in the diligence  speed  and correction to what is essentially a  hinky  mouse that may or may not be manufacturer defect   they didn t question the problem with the mouse and immediately offered an upgraded mouse for free with no need for me to go through the exhausting exchange and return refund experience   i just contacted them with the problem and they responded  corrected the issue  and had a new mouse available to me within about   hours of my first contact   this is truly excellence in customer service and pride in their products   i cannot recommend this seller enough in their ability and care in response  correction  and ability to provide truly awesome service   this is a seller that should fall into what i call  stellar seller  on amazon   amazing service and quality products and they actually do honor their guarantee without argument or lack of speed and response   truly and honest seller invested in their products   as a long time amazon shopper    this experience is in my top   for excellence and i highly recommend them for their service as being awesome  fast  and totally easy   thanks so much for making this christmas gift as great as it was when i bought it   truly a trusted and honest seller   would recommend again and again            
70,5.0,                       i m really glad that i finally got this after waiting  it s excellent quality and it s beautiful the light goes out into sleep mode if you re not using it and it s easy to plug in to an external hub or into the pc  it was a great investment and it came with a matching mouse which i am not currently using at the moment  i was concerned that the lights and controls on my mac wouldn t be triggered on this keyboard  but the keys work perfectly   i can press volume down and up on this keyboard and i don t have to lean over to reach my mac   i love it so much   just plug it into the computer or the external  hub and then restart your computer and it should work perfectly  i want to get a second one  probably the white pastel in the near future for my other office  i don t want to chance breaking them  by moving them around too much  it is a bit big and little heavy  but i like that  i feel it s sturdy      
71,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          since the time when i was a wee lad  i ve become a slave to the sub par keyboards that have been allowed to roam the earth  bound by their tyranny  i always dreamed of one day finding a savior to free my from my prison  twas the night before christmas when a sponsored ad by amazon found itself upon my screen  my savior had arrived to take his place on the throne    and amazon chose me to join him  i followed thy lord of keyboards to the checkout screen and placed the order    moons later it arrived  twas a majestic sight to say the least  from the moment the king s usb connector slid himself ever so gently into my computer  he claimed his throne on my desk   never to be moved again i bought this keyboard to find an improvement on my previous keyboards and instead discovered the true meaning of love  its a beautifully crafted piece of mastery  and at its price  we should all be singing of lord havit s grace  our keyboard  who art fulfilled by amazon  hallowed be thy game      
72,5.0,                       it s a very nice keyboard  i was surprised with it thinking it was going to feel cheap  but it actually doesn t feel cheap  it doesn t feel top quality though  more like a mid range quality  which i feel is good considering the price  it s laid out well  though some may not like the shape of the enter key  the led lights are very bright  which makes it a shame that the letters themselves are not backlit  just behind the keys  the keys themselves feel alright  the arrow keys have a nice feel as they have a slight circular indentation  i kinda wish all the keys were like that overall  i d say for the price this is a great keyboard for this price range  not for a pro gamer  but lower end or beginner gamer or just standard users would find this a great keyboard  better than the tecknet gryphon keyboard from the same price range i also recently reviewed edit  forgot to note that i did not really need nor try the mouse  at a glance  it looks pretty cool and not bad  but i haven t tried it  so i can t put an opinion about it in this review      
73,4.0,                       i needed to purchase a new keyboard and mouse as my existing ones had seen some use and were no longer viable   i purchased this combo set  not for the colors but because it s a mechanical keyboard and both keyboard and mouse are wired i am overall very happy with the keyboard and mouse   i type a lot and a i type fast and the keyboard is very easy for me to use   the only thing that i am not happy with is the fact that it s missing a menu key   i didn t realize that when i purchased it as i thought it was standard one keyboards these days   i was wrong   however  i am often hitting where the menu key was on my last keyboard set and it s not there so i have to use the mouse now   it s not a huge deal  but i prefer doing as much with the keyboard and less with the mouse      
74,2.0,                       this is a back lit keyboard   the problem is you can t see the keys  even in a completely dark room and the keyboard light illumination setting on  high    the green lighting is readable   the blue  less so  but the purple is completely unreadable     or whatever color it s supposed to be   before anybody says anything  i am not colorblind  so that s not the issue it could be acceptable if all the back lighting was green the keys on  the keyboard had a nice feel   no complaint there however  i would not recommend this product to a friend   i might recommend it to somebody i didn t like      
75,4.0,                       this isn t my favorite keyboard    for the price  it s pretty good  but the keys feel clunky  they require a pretty deep press  the backlighting while pretty isn t adjustable at all   you get a simple on   off but no brightness control   not bad for the price  but not at all what i was really looking for   coming from a g    gaming mouse the mouse feels really lightweight  it needs more mass all in all i can t complain much for the price  but if you have a few extra bucks     go for better      
76,4.0,                       this keyboard functions very well  and my daughter loves it i can t give it   stars though  because of a significant annoyance  several of the special characters  such as   and    iirc  are not in their standard locations  and cannot  be remapped  the company doesn t offer and software or drivers to remap keys  so that at least the key icons would match what was typed on screen  and said their is nothing they can do to help  i haven t tried replacing the  mislabeled  keys with some from a standard keyboard  so i don t know if that would work      
77,1.0,                       spacebar not  spacing  when using far right side of spacebar  black coating wearing off all high use keys   spacebar  coating peeling creates a lot of distracting light coming through      of right motion button fell off  jammed key   had to use tweezers to pull out of keyboard  keyboard was purchased oct             worked great for over a month  then issues started popping up  contacting havitdirect is extremely difficult  buy the   year extended warranty through amazon   because dealing this way   costs more time  than the keyboard was ever worth      
78,2.0,                       i bought his keyboard for my    year old s gaming pc  it was delivered on may   th and like you would expect it was plug and play  my son said he liked it  all good  today is july   th and my son said he couldn t enter his password because the  n  key does not work  i didn t think that was possible with a   month old keyboard so i tried for myself and found the the  b  and  m  keys also do not work  my son said he knew that but it wasn t a big deal because none of his passwords had a  b  or  m  in it   i wasn t expecting anything extraordinary from such an inexpensive keyboard but my son didn t need the keyboard for anything other than logging in once in awhile  having it fail after just   months is pretty disappointing  i sincerely hope you keep looking for other options cause this keyboard is junk      
79,5.0,                       works great as intended  i use it for mostly work and occasional gaming and i ve found it to be greatly suited to my needs  first we can start with the keyboard  i actually really enjoy the ergonomics of the keyboard compared to my old one  it is not a mechanical keyboard but the keys press down with good depth and bounce back fairly well  i have no issues typing on it and when i am playing games  it feels really comfortable  i really enjoy the fact that you can change the colors how you want it as well as change the intensity  the keyboard comes with other functional buttons like sound control which is essential  next is the mouse and it also does a good job feeling comfortable in my hand  i have no issues using the mouse while also feeling natural  colors are a nice additional touch but my only complaint is that you are not able to change the colors of the mouse  it will periodically change by itself and you do not have any control over that  the dpi on the mouse is amazing and theres a button that allows you to change the sensitivity and dpi of your mouse which is awesome because you can change it to fit your needs  also has a forward and backwards function key on the mouse which is great when you are scrolling the web  otherwise i think this is a perfect combo if you want something that works for productivity at work or for gaming      
80,5.0,                        original post  plugged it in but one of the keys is non functional  kind of pointless when you can t type with a keyboard  specifically the a key was not working at all  update  so i got a new keyboard through amazon  so far it a been very nice and comfortable to use  very responsive for an inexpensive keyboard with the nice lighting  and amazon did a great job in fixing the issue      
81,3.0,                       i was under the impression the color of the keyboard could be changed  but all i do is turn it on or off and change its brightness  so off it is   the enter key is a different shape than i am used to so that will take some getting used to but the keys themselves do have a nice touch to them   it would be nice if the angle could be brought up a little bit more  i really don t care the for the feel of the mouse or where the back and forward buttons fall in relation to my thumb and with no ability to turn the obnoxious scrolling lighting off  i got rid of it and am just using my original dell mouse      
82,4.0,                       i d like to say that this was probably the best membrane keyboard i ve ever used as a gamer i m never been a fan of membrane  especially cheap keyboards  but at the time i needed something for my second workstation and came across this bundle  at first i was skeptical but once i recieved it and played a few games with it i was slightly impressed  although theres one thing that stands out and that is the the key separation is alittle bit much compared to your standard key boards  although with sometime you get used to it  just be aware that once you go back to a mechanical switch keyboard you re not gonna wanna go back to the membrane but another thing that fascinated me about this keyboard was the durability and build quality  its actually built well and i ve encountered a hugh beer spill on the keyboard and mouse  i unplugged  it  ran it under water and let it sit out upside down to dry for   days and it worked perfectly fine i ended up giving it to my brother as i got new keyboards with cherry mx blues and new logitech g series and corsair mice  but again for the new beginner gamers who are looking for something at a extremely affordable price this works fine  but keep in mind their are better options out there like reddragon for example with outemu switches which feel just like cherry mx  but again this is still a great deal      
83,2.0,                       i am not a typist  even though the keyboard keys light up  i find it difficult to read the keypad numbers  also the top row of numbers on the keyboard arn t fully illuminated the mouse has a mind of its  own  at times causing me to have to hit the space bar or even reseat the usb plug to rein in the mouse i will look at other combos in the near future to replace what i have      
84,2.0,                       if you play mmos  this will not stand up to wear   tear of raiding  the left mouse button has stopped responding  sometimes the mouse sensor doesn t respond at all  my keys are wearing away   the backspace sticks   i ve only had this for two months  it s a pretty set but the functionally and quality lacks too much      
85,1.0,                       i just spiked it on the floor   then made sure to football spike it again a few times to make sure it was dead   then i threw it in the trash   then i washed my old keyboard in the dishwasher and blow dried it  and am cooling down the keys aren t very resistant to dust  and the spacebar key has a spring loaded in it  that makes it very difficult to put back in if you want to clean it the right way   i considered dishwashing it  but didn t make it   i just couldn t stand the spacebar key  and decided it was better if i just destroyed it   the keys on my older keyboard  the one that comes with the stock acer predator orion  are flatter and easier to type with  apparently resistant to water  and much easier to press i also write and like to type fast  and the damn thing wasn t responsive on awsd for gaming after limited use  and the spacebar key was the worst   while typing  i my thumb got tired of the force needed to hit the spacebar   during games like division   when you have to hit spacebar to dodge a lot  i got dead it s better this way   the experience was good at first  but it had a longevity of like a month   i m running with flatter key keyboards instead of big button keys from now on   i considered returning it  but throwing a tantrum and learning it a lesson was much more satisfying      
86,1.0,                       the description is very ambiguous and ultimately  this is not what i expected nor what i wanted  i am not a gamer and i do not want breathing or pulsating lights on my keyboard or mouse   while you can stop the breathing of the keyboard  you can not stop it on the mouse  the mouse lights are somewhat programmable through software  which by the way you have to search all over the internet to find  however  you can only slow down the breathing   not stop it in addition  the keyboard light can not be set to a single color   it is fixed at a rainbow spectrum  as shown in the photos   all i want is a subtle backlight of a single color on the mouse and keyboard that doesn t pulsate or breath so i can work in a low light setting as if that wasn t frustrating enough  the space key is loud as heck   as it springs back up  it makes a pop sound  i type fast  so it winds up sounding like a machine gun as soon as i submit this review  i am processing a return  instead of the name havit  it should be have had it      
87,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          we got this and hooked it up today  so far so good  everything works as it should  my boys ages        bought this and thought it was the coolest thing ever  they were not disappointed  the lights on the keyboard do not change color  but the mouse does change color  you can see the difference of lighting in the video we posted  there will be some adjustment to the keyboard placement  since our old one was set up a bit different  but that s to be expected      
88,5.0,                       i ve waited to write this review since i wanted to properly use this keyboard and mouse i just want to say  its everything you really need  the keyboard feels really nice and the buttons are very smooth as well  i love the way it clicks and the anti ghosting feature makes gaming feel a lot much better the colors on both the mouse and keyboard are pretty too  they change colors and aren t too bright to hurt your eyes in the dark but are bright enough to show under my lights in summary  i think this was one of my better purchases and hopefully it lasts longer than the other keyboards i have tried in the past      
89,2.0,                       oh got where do i begin   first i love the two other havit keyboards i have   both are mechanical in style  accurate and fast   this kit was budget oriented  so i thought i would get something like a cheap non mechanical logi  but instead  this keyboard is straight out of the pre pentium era the tall keys are super mushy   i can t even describe how bad they are   however its nothing compared to the mouse the buttons are bad  the response time on the mouse is way worse   literally there was    ish second delay of input with this mouse   tried on multiple ports to no avail   compared to an old beat up anker  that i love  on the same computer  it wasn t even close   the old anker with its worn out buttons and heavily used shell  dominated this brand new rgb mouse in literally every regard  except the havit had a super bright rainbow rgb the lag makes this mouse unusable for gaming or precision tasks  this isn t my first cheapo mouse  but this has been the worst   good luck trying to play any sort of fps game on top of that when you pick up the havit mouse  it still picks up motion   no other laser or optical mouse i have used has ever sensed movement after being picked up of the surface   as a gamer i do this alot  and my aim literally with jump all over the place as you pick it up and reposition it  even up to about      off the surface   unusable  period if you are buying for looks  then this kit looks great   for the price to have something to just browse the internet  it should work fine i stole my beat up anker back from my wife for less than a day and she took this mouse   first    mins of work she immediately asked me to buy her a new mouse or give back the anker  she won t take the keyboard either as she despises typing on it this is a bummer as the two other havit keyboards are top notch   i type this review now on my main rig with the havit mechanical   great keyboard   but this particular combo should be shelved   it is bad all around     stars for awesome rgb        
90,4.0,                       i bought this keyboard a while ago after my laptop keyboard experienced a broken key  it was a very comfortable experience  and very easy to adapt to the key placements  it s got a great  responsive feel  and a pleasing aesthetic  for the     i spent on it  it really is a pleasing keyboard for a budget however  i d say the mouse is a hard pass  for one  it felt massive and chunky in my hand  like i could barely cover it  the changing colors also was surprisingly distracting  quite a few times i thought it was my phone going off due to the transition  but the most jarring issue of all  that gives me the hard pass  is that fact the mouse had a very odd tendency to stop responding for a few seconds every now and then i have no idea why  as previous mouses have worked flawlessly before  and i tested it with every usb slot on my computer to be sure it wasn t a usb issue  but the issue persisted  despite being fully powered  for some reason the mouse would simply not respond for those few  odd seconds so if you re buying this combo  know that while the keyboard is quite nice for something so budget oriented  the mouse you ll more than likely wish to replace  the mouse may not be so bad if you re one with a bigger hand size  unlike i  but if this problem of not responding is a common occurrence  it s definitely a deal breaker      
91,4.0,                       for the price  these are good products   the mouse works great and has adjustable lighting   the keyboard operates smoothly and is a great size for someone with larger hands like i have   the only issue i have with it is either the lighting on the keyboard is a bit dim  or the letters on it aren t large enough to really see   also  i was under the impression that the keyboard could be adjusted to different colors   this is true of the mouse  but not the keyboard   the keyboard only has the rainbow color shown available in bright dim pulse settings      
92,5.0,              your browser does not support html  video                          the combo set was nicely packaged and the first look i am impressed  the keyboard and mouse both are well built  before i had a mechanical gaming keyboard but this one is way quieter the backlights on the keyboard so beautiful  and you can change different types of colors and patterns   the set came with instruction manual which shows how to program the keyboard colors also  the mouse is beautiful and you can control the dpi from the top white button located on the mouse  i have an expensive logitech gaming mouse but surprisingly this cheaper  mouse gives me similar scores in battlefield   online   this is a good option to give as a gift and it looks   the only cons i think of it is mouse size may be suitable for some and for others they need to adjust it      
93,4.0,                       the keys feel nice  and the lighting is cool  just a disclaimer  the rainbow light does not rotate  and there is no setting to change the keyboard to a solid color  i am using this as a temporary keyboard and i am pleased  but if you want something that changes color  look for something that says rgb the mouse feels really nice  and i will probably keep the mouse as long as possible since i don t need more than   buttons at the moment  the mouse rotates through colors  but there s not a way to stop it on a certain color  at least not that i m aware of   decent product  and worth it for the price i think      
94,5.0,                       originally purchased in october       it s january      now and the keyboard and mouse are still going strong  i leave my computer on for weeks at time and lights on both items are still just as bright  only issue is the kickstand on the back of the keyboard is broken on one side but that s usually the first thing to go anyway  all in all it was a great buy update  september     it finally happened  my keyboard died  i spilled a little bit of tea on it which got between the keys  cleaned what i could and called it a night  the next day some of the keys weren t working correctly so i opened the keyboard up to see if i could troubleshoot it further   since it s spillproof i thought it would be ok but nope  the drainage holes didn t do much of anything and liquid was in the lcd lights and key press circuit thingy  functionality got worse after cleaning it further and putting it back together  hoping i can still find a way to fix it but for now it s unusable      
95,1.0,                       my husband is an autocad drafter so hes on the comp all day and is pretty rough on keyboards  i had bought him this exact keyboard about a year and a half ago and it was amazing for him  he went to the purchase again option and the new one he recieved was junk  it was super loud  the space bar was smaller  and he said it wasnt as comfortable to use   i dont know what they did to change their product so dramatically in such a short time period but we ended up returning this and going with a different brand      
96,1.0,                       three keys are already wearing off after   months of moderate use  also  the  design is poor  you have to push two keys to change the volume  something i want to do all the time   also  one of the keys is the fn key which is all the way to the right so it makes it harder  they have one key to change the keyboard backlight  which i never want to do but always accidentally do    poor quality and design      
97,5.0,                       my keyboard s spacebar was broken  just to the point of being annoying  my mouse finally stopped working after a long time  so i decided to just replace them both i need a keyboard where the buttons are raised and spaced out nicely  i hate flat keys and thin keyboards  this does the job perfectly it feels nice and precise and the colors are pretty cool too  one review pointed out that there s an extra key between the quotation button and enter button and it can be kind of annoying since most keyboards don t have that  it is true it can be annoying  especially since the enter button seems to be smaller because of it  but i ve already gotten used to it after about a week the mouse is nice  but it s a little long for me  i like the bottom of my palm to be resting on my desk and with this mouse  my whole hand fits on it  not a big deal  just an observation that might drive some people a little crazy overall i am pleased with this purchase  especially given the quality of both mouse and keyboard for a low price      
98,2.0,                       i have purchased   of these  the bad  both of them stopped working due to some construction issues with where the cord is attached to the keyboard  i found myself having to adjust align the cord to regain functionality  eventually it got so bad that replacement was necessary i also preferred the older version of this keyboard  where the volume buttons were on the left edge of the keyboard  i could be gaming and adjust the volume up or down with my left hand   the new keyboard requires both hands to adjust the volume  by holding down the fn button with the right hand while adjusting the volume with the f    f  buttons with the left hand   i don t like this   when gaming  i sometimes have to quick adjust in the middle of action  prefer to have the simpler  quicker method of having separate volume buttons overall i liked the keyboard  but i just don t think i can invest in another one of these  despite the affordable price  i can t even get a full year of use out of them  and i am not even a heavy gamer  i m a moderate user at best  with     of my usage coming from typing for work   on the internet      
99,5.0,                       it s a decent keyboard  definitely an upgrade from what i was using  was very easy to start using this keyboard  as there s often a discomfort with a new keyboard  getting comfortable with new spacing and everything  but i found that wasn t an issue with this keyboard  i was immediately comfortable using it however  bc of how the keys are set up  and i m not one to likes to smash my keys  i just find it doesn t always recognize  immediately  what i m wanting it to do  this happens most often with the space bar when i m trying to jump  i find my thumb having to work harder than it usually does to make sure a double jump gets registered overall  if you re looking for a cheap keyboard that s good for gaming  this might suit your needs  if you can spare extra coin  though    i would recommend spending extra coin      
100,5.0,                       for the price  i really can t see how you can get a better keyboard than this  not to mention the mouse    the mouse is the coolest feature for me because it pulsates between colors  i wish the keyboard would  but i think that might be a design thing when you re looking at the keyboard  the blue side is mainly for your left hand  red side right hand  green side numbers on the side  then in between those colors are a small amount of purple  yellow  orange  it looks cool for sure i like the feel of the keys too  i m usually more of a fan of smaller keys so you can type faster  but this doesn t seem to slow me down much  i m also going to school for programming and enjoy typing system language with this keyboard as well      
101,5.0,                       this is a cheap keyboard without any junk i needed to install  nothing will bug me to update it constantly  and when i press a button one time  it does the thing   once   not more than once  just once  perfect  this is exactly what i was looking for if you want a fancy  heavy keyboard that has all the do dads and bing bangs  get a different one  then deal with that company s junk software bothering you all the time  get a mechanical keyboard so that when you press a button once it enters that button three times  all so that you can use that backspace more often  fun or just get this keyboard  the lights aren t super bright  sure  it doesn t have a lot of weight to it  you might even want to get a pad for your desk so it doesn t slide around  i m telling you  though  this simple keyboard is all you need it keyboards  and it doesn t bother you about it      
102,2.0,                       edit  keyboard stopped working after   months  it s a massive shame because i really loved that keyboard  mouse works still  but if you re clicking a lot i find there s finger strain because it has more resistance to clicking than a lot of other mice i ve tried love it love it love it  it s everything i could have asked for and more  beautiful keyboard  beautiful lights  quiet responsive button presses  mouse is amazing  and works flawlessly  it matches my computer tower as well with the rainbow leds  i absolutely adore it  best budget keyboard   mouse combo i could have ever asked for      
103,5.0,                       just got it today  had some issues with ups putting it at a neighbors house but it s a busy time of year and i got it in the end so meh  the lighting looks great  kind of wish i could select colors but it s nice anyways  i don t see an option to select   color for the mouse either  that annoys me more  i like having a single color mouse  loving the product though so far  though if i do run in to any issues i will update the review i will note this is the first mouse i ve had issues with it jumping around while on my desk  but putting it on a matte surface fixes that  it s not an actual issue  just fyi incase other people have the same      
104,5.0,                       i purchase these headphones on wednesday and i must say i am a happy  the headphones are not just great for the price compared to overprice or expensive headphones but these gaming headphones are definitely competition  the usb on the headphones are roped which means less likely to have that shortage in the usb cord  and feel durable  it also came with an adapter splitter piece which allows you to plug in for microphone and headphones  it is a bit short and wish it was longer but oh well no biggie there  i immediately plugged the headset into my laptop and played some music  boom complete sound control i hear nothing that is going on such as tv  or if anyone is talking to me  because the sounds is completely between my ears and whats playing  if you take off the headset while music or sound is playing the sound is pretty loud  however not loud to where it hurts your ears  it has volume control and a switch for turning mic on or off  i even plugged into my xbox controller and the sound was great completely isolated  i am a happer camper  thanks for making a great product and looking out on the price      
105,5.0,                       my   year old wanted the pricey razer set because of course all of the gamers she watches on youtube use it  so i found this set  which is much more reasonably priced  and offered it up as a compromise  she loves it  it looks great and she says it is very comfortable to use  so  score one for mom  and for anyone else out there trying to keep up with the expensive tech trends   don t hesitate  this set is awesome      
106,5.0,                       i am a first time buyer of pc  products and this keyboard was first to arrive at my door  when i opened the amazon box i was pleased to find out it was mine and not my brothers package  as i opened i saw a nice black box that i soon figured out was the box cover under that cover was a bright orange box that said  hello  thank you for choosing havit   this was a nice introduction to the new keyboard and mouse combo i had ordered  the packaging was great too  this box had latches that held the rest of the cardboard in place until unlatched  i will definitely reuse the box  upon opening it i saw a mouse with its own nice and tidy plastic compartment and a keyboard wrapped in a nice soft packaging material that covered it almost entirely except from the side that it was pulled out from  i plugged both the keyboard and mouse in and they both worked as advertised  it took a couple seconds to get the lights running but it did in fact work  the lights flooded rainbow color across the board and the mouse started in its red position then started  breathing  colors  i did see music changing keys that also excited me reading through the manual that was included i figured out a couple new things about the keyboard and mouse  one thing i didn t figure out is how to change your keyboard and or mouse to a specific color of your choosing  i still don t know if it is possible but if its not i would be fine with it  although if you are looking for a color themed computer this would not be the keyboard for you unless i m not doing something right to change the color to what i want but i do believe the mouse is unchangeable so that would almost have to mean the keyboard is as well  to rate this product i would say i am very satisfied with my product it was just a little hard to know about the colors when you don t read amazon s print over the product but its fine i m still happy with it      
107,4.0,                       the keyboard is a great beginners basic gaming keyboard  it works nicely  no problems thus far  the rainbow backlight is nice and calming and not too overdone  i haven t done too much experimenting to see if you can turn the backlight off  one complaint i have is that the actual keys themselves do not light up so when playing in the dark you see the backlight but all of the keys are darkened by the competing light and overall lack of light in the room  we have a booklight that we clip on to the keyboard for when it is being used at night so we can see all of the keys and know what they are  if you become quickly adapted to the lay of the keyboard it won t be an issue  but regardless of how used to or how long i ve used a keyboard  i tend to always need the keys to be lit up      
108,5.0,                       this keyboard and mouse were very inexpensive with the extra coupon savings   everything works fine and the leds add a little bling   it is different than my older  business  style keyboards   they keys sit very high on the board and have a lot of travel   they feel fine  just different than what i am used   mouse work fine  the leds cycle with the dpi setting and have a breathing pattern   mouse is very sensitive though   i had to change the sensitivity in windows      
109,1.0,                       mouse works great  love it  overall the keyboard is great too  a good  comfortable size and lovely to look at    at least when the lights turn on  sometimes the keyboard lighting just doesn t turn on   like the keyboard functions like it should  but the light is super dim or is just not on at all  if i wiggle the cord  sometimes it turns all the way on and it s fine then but that s sort of a bummer will update if necessary but that s what i m dealing with now update it s not the power cable  it s probably something inside the keyboard  there must be a spot where its not connected properly or all the way  pushing down on the sides of the keyboard turns the lights on  and they ll stay on bright for a few minutes but then flicker and die down  i can only assume something came loose inside the actual keyboard  or it s not lined up properly  either way  i was going to try to try and make sure the screws were tight and not loose on the back but there s already   screws that have been a bit stripped  it may be something that happened in the assembly as there is some damage to the plastic around the   spots  but i m not confident i want to bother with it  at this point  the lights pretty much wont turn on at all     
110,5.0,                       keyboardpros  great valvue  easy to use  and good looking  the lights work as they are designed to with simple on off and   brightness  breath light effect the mouse is pretty comfortable and simple to set up and use  the quick dpi are good for quick adjustments cons  the keyboard has key set up that might hinder game players because there is extra column of keys to the left of tab keys  the keyboard has rubber feet to stop it from slipping but when you use the front keyboard legs to stand up the rubber feet do not touch ghe ground and the keyboard becomes pretty slippery  the mouse has the dpi button close to the center of the mouse that sometimes gets pressed accidently customer service pros  after mentioning the slipper feet of the product to the cust care agent  the agent quickly responded and emailed me back a solution and a replacement product  the agent was extremely apologetic and respectful about the issues i had cons  the agent lacks full grasp of the english language and the communication was slightly tough because of that but because of the quick responses i was able to make sure we were clear on what was happening overall a worth buy  i recommend use mouse mat or keyboard mat for the bottom of the keyboard    however i like the product and rate it
